AB Individual differences in working memory are an important source of information for refining theories of memory and cognition. Computational modeling is an effective tool for studying individual differences because it allows researchers to maintain the basic structure of a theory while perturbing a particular component. This paper presents a computational model for a digit working memory task and demonstrates that varying a single parameter captures individual differences in that task. The model is developed within the framework of the ACT-R theory (Anderson, 1993), and the continuous parameter manipulated represents attentional capacity for the current goal.

AB A large-sample (n = 75) fMRI study guided the development of a theory of how people extend their problem-solving procedures by reflecting on them. Both children and adults were trained on a new mathematical procedure and then were challenged with novel problems that required them to change and extend their procedure to solve these problems. The fMRI data were analyzed using a combination of hidden Markov models (HMMs) and multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA). This HMM-MVPA analysis revealed the existence of 4 stages: Encoding, Planning, Solving, and Responding. Using this analysis as a guide, an ACT-R model was developed that improved the performance of the HMM-MVPA and explained the variation in the durations of the stages across 128 different problems. The model assumes that participants can reflect on declarative representations of the steps of their problem-solving procedures. A Metacognitive module can hold these steps, modify them, create new declarative steps, and rehearse them. The Metacognitive module is associated with activity in the rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC). The ACT-R model predicts the activity in the RLPFC and other regions associated with its other cognitive modules (e.g., vision, retrieval). Differences between children and adults seemed related to differences in background knowledge and computational fluency, but not to the differences in their capability to modify procedures.

AB Designing human machine interfaces that respect the ergonomic norms and following rigorous approaches constitutes a major concern for computer systems designers. The increased need on easily accessible and usable interfaces leads researchers in this domain to create methods and models that make it possible to evaluate these interfaces in terms of utility and usability. Two different approaches are currently used to evaluate human machine interfaces, empirical approaches that require user involvement in the interface development process, and analytical approaches that do not associate the user during the interface development process. This paper presents a study of user performance on two principal tasks of the contextual assistant's interface, developed in the context of smart homes, to assist persons with cognitive disabilities. We use three different methods to analyze and evaluate this interface, focusing basically on time of execution. Two of the models developed are based on cognitive models, which are ACT-R and GOMS and the third one is based on the Fitts' Law model. The results show that, all models give a good prediction of user performance, even if the cognitive models show better accuracy of the user performance. Furthermore, they provide a better insight into cognitive abilities required to interact with the interface. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Research spanning decades has generated a long list of phenomena associated with human spatial information processing. Additionally, a number of theories have been proposed about the representation, organization and processing of spatial information by humans. This paper presents a broad account of human spatial competence, integrated with the ACT-R cognitive architecture. Using a cognitive architecture grounds the research in a validated theory of human cognition, enhancing the plausibility of the overall account. This work posits a close link of aspects of spatial information processing to vision and motor planning, and integrates theoretical perspectives that have been proposed over the history of research in this area. In addition, the account is supported by evidence from neuropsychological investigations of human spatial ability. The mechanisms provide a means of accounting for a broad range of phenomena described in the experimental literature.

AB Most tasks can be pursued by using different strategies (Logan, 1985; Reder & Schunn, 1998). In this paper we focus on strategies of learning from worked-out examples. Within a resource-oriented framework these different strategics can be classified according to their costs and benefits. These features may determine which strategy will be selected for accomplishing a task in situations with certain resource limitations. We investigate specific hypotheses about strategic adaptations to resource limitations (e.g., time pressure or lack of prior knowledge) within a hypertext-based learning environment. A comparison of the strategy selection of good and poor learners is used to assess the degree of subjects' resource adaptivity. Ideas for modeling resource-adaptive selection of strategies within the ACT-R architecture are discussed.

AB Because morphological and syntactic constraints govern the distribution of potential antecedents for local anaphors, local antecedent retrieval might be expected to make equal use of both syntactic and morphological cues. However, previous research (e.g., Dillon et al., 2013) has shown that local antecedent retrieval is not susceptible to the same morphological interference effects observed during the resolution of morphologically-driven grammatical dependencies, such as subject-verb agreement checking (e.g., Peal-a-nutter et al., 1999). Although this lack of interference has been taken as evidence that syntactic cues are given priority over morphological cues in local antecedent retrieval, the absence of interference could also be the result of a confound in the materials used: the post-verbal position of local anaphors in prior studies may obscure morphological interference that would otherwise be visible if the critical anaphor were in a different position. We investigated the licensing of local anaphors (reciprocals) in Hindi, an SOV language, in order to determine whether pre-verbal anaphors are subject to morphological interference from feature-matching distractors in a way that post-verbal anaphors are not. Computational simulations using a version of the ACT-R parser (Lewis and Vasishth, 2005) predicted that a feature-matching distractor should facilitate the processing of an unlicensed reciprocal if morphological cues are used in antecedent retrieval. In a self-paced reading study we found no evidence that distractors eased processing of an unlicensed reciprocal. However, the presence of a distractor increased difficulty of processing following the reciprocal. We discuss the significance of these results for theories of cue selection in retrieval.

AB Neural correlate of human inductive reasoning process is still unclear. Number series and letter series completion are two typical inductive reasoning tasks, and with a common core component of rule induction. Previous studies have demonstrated that different strategies are adopted in number series and letter series completion tasks; even the underlying rules are identical. In the present study, we examined cortical activation as a function of two different reasoning strategies for solving series completion tasks. The retrieval strategy, used in number series completion tasks, involves direct retrieving of arithmetic knowledge to get the relations between items. The procedural strategy, used in letter series completion tasks, requires counting a certain number of times to detect the relations linking two items. The two strategies require essentially the equivalent cognitive processes, but have different working memory demands (the procedural strategy incurs greater demands). The procedural strategy produced significant greater activity in areas involved in memory retrieval (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, DLPFC) and mental representation/maintenance (posterior parietal cortex, PPC). An ACT-R model of the tasks successfully predicted behavioral performance and BOLD responses. The present findings support a general-purpose dual-process theory of inductive reasoning regarding the cognitive architecture. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Previous accounts of cognitive skill acquisition have demonstrated how procedural knowledge can be obtained and transformed over time into skilled task performance. This article focuses on a complementary aspect of skill acquisition, namely the integration and reuse of previously known component skills. The article posits that, in addition to mechanisms that proceduralize knowledge into more efficient forms, skill acquisition requires tight integration of newly acquired knowledge and previously learned knowledge. Skill acquisition also benefits from reuse of existing knowledge across disparate task domains, relying on indexicals to reference and share necessary information across knowledge components. To demonstrate these ideas, the article proposes a computational model of skill acquisition from instructions focused on integration and reuse, and applies this model to account for behavior across seven task domains.

AB Planning a path to a destination, given a number of options and obstacles, is a common task. We suggest a two-component cognitive model that combines retrieval of knowledge about the environment with search guided by visual perception. In the first component, subsymbolic information, acquired during navigation, aids in the retrieval of declarative information representing possible paths to take. In the second component, visual information directs the search, which in turn creates knowledge for the first component. The model is implemented using the ACT-R cognitive architecture and makes realistic assumptions about memory access and shifts in visual attention. We present simulation results for memory-based high-level navigation in grid and tree structures, and visual navigation in mazes, varying relevant cognitive (retrieval noise and visual finsts) and environmental (maze and path size) parameters. The visual component is evaluated with data from a multi-robot control experiment, where subjects planned paths for robots to explore a building. We describe a method to compare trajectories without referring to aligned points in the itinerary. The evaluation shows that the model provides a good fit, but also that planning strategies may vary with task loads.

AB A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was performed in which participants performed a complex series of mental calculations that spanned about 2 min. An Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) model [Anderson, J. R. How can the human mind occur in the physical universe? New York: Oxford University Press, 2007] was developed that successfully fit the distribution of latencies. This model generated predictions for the fMRI signal in six brain regions that have been associated with modules in the ACT-R theory. The model's predictions were confirmed for a fusiform region that reflects the visual module, for a prefrontal region that reflects the retrieval module, and for an anterior cingulate region that reflects the goal module. In addition, the only significant deviations to the motor region that reflects the manual module were anticipatory hand movements. In contrast, the predictions were relatively poor for a parietal region that reflects an imaginal module and for a caudate region that reflects the procedural module.

AB Models of users are a way to understand and improve the usability of computer interfaces. We present here a model in ACT-R cognitive-modeling language that interacts with a publicly available driving simulation as a simple analog for robot interfaces. The model interacts with the unmodified Java interface by incorporating a novel use of bitmap parsing. The model's structure starts to describe the knowledge a human operator of a robot must have. The model also indicates some of the aspects of the task will be difficult for the operator. For example, the model's performance makes quantitative predictions about how robot speed will influence navigation quality, correlating well to human performance. While the model does not cover all aspects of human-robot interaction, it illustrates how providing user models access to an interface through its bitmap can lead to more accurate and more widely applicable model users.

AB Cognitive Constraint Modeling (CCM) is an approach to reasoning about behavior that (1) provides a framework for investigating the hypothesis that skilled behavior is the optimal solution to a constraint satisfaction problem defined by objective, environmental, knowledge, and architectural constraints, (2) derives predictions of behavior from formal specifications of theory, (3) supports reasoning using both dependency-based and cascade-based ontologies for expressing temporal relationships between processes. A software tool that demonstrates the potential advantages of CCM is described. The tool, called CORE, can be used to partially automate the generation of behavioral predictions given a specification of the constraints. We explore the application of CORE to dual-task data previously modeled with EPIC and ACT-R.

AB Sterman (1989) proposed that decision makers misperceive the feedback provided by dynamically complex environments, and questioned whether people can learn to make effective decisions in such environments. We provide empirical evidence of learning in a well-known dynamic environment called the beer game. We then describe a preliminary version of an instance-based, dynamic decision making model built using the ACT-R cognitive architecture. The model mimics the general patterns of human behavior observed for aggregate performance across trials and local performance within trials. Implications for research on dynamic decision making are summarized.

Mothers reported more communal themes (F{5, 83} = 2: 32, p < .05). Correlations between generativity and well-being resulted in a negative relationship for mothers in parenting communal generative acts (r = -.41, p = .007) and total generative acts (r = -.3, p = .05) as assessed by the interview. Negative correlations also emerged between mothers' well-being and communal generative acts from the Generative Behavior Checklist, (r = -.33, p = .02).

AB The size of fan effects is determined by processes at retrieval, not by whether or not information is represented as situations. Evidence contradicts G. A. Radvansky's (1999) claim that time to retrieve information from a situation does not depend on the number of elements in the situation. Moreover, Radvansky's principles for ascribing situational models to experiments appear to be post hoc ways of redescribing the data. On the other hand, the evidence does support the Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) assumption that participants can adjust their attentional weightings and so produce differential fan effects. Moreover, the ACT-R theory of the fan effect is consistent with many other findings.

AB We have been refining a cognitive model, written in ACT-R, of student performance in early algebra problem solving. "Early algebra" refers to a class of problems and competencies at the boundary between arithmetic and algebra. Our empirical studies in this domain establish a striking contrast between students' difficulties with symbolic algebra and their relative success with certain kinds of "intuitive" algebraic reasoning. To better understand this contrast, we analyzed student solutions to identify the strategies and errors exhibited and then set out to account for this detailed process data with the utility-based choice mechanism of ACT-R. Our first model contained production rules for explicitly selecting strategies and for making certain systematic errors or bugs. It provided a good quantitative fit to student performance data (R-2=.90), however, it had two qualitative shortcomings: 1) the productions for strategy selection appeared to serve no computational purpose and 2) the model systematically underpredicted the frequency of non-trivial errors on more complex problems. We created a new model in which explicit strategy selection was eliminated (strategic behavior is emergent) and in which failure to fire a production (an implicit, non-buggy error) is an option at every model choice point. Compared to the first model, this model achieved an equivalent quantitative fit with fewer productions and without the systematic deviations from the error data. We consider the implications of implicit strategies and errors for instruction.

AB The cognitive and decision science literature on modeling and aiding intuitions in organizations is rich, but segregated. This special issue offers a sample of that literature, stimulating exchange and inspiring intuitions about intuition. A total of 16 articles bring together diverse approaches, such as naturalistic-decision-making, heuristics-and-biases, dual-processes, ACT-R, CLARION, Brunswikian, and Quantum-Probability-Theory, many of them co-authored by their founders. The articles cover computational models and verbal theories; experimental and observational work; laboratory and naturalistic research. Comprising various domains, such as consulting, investment, law, police, and morality, the articles relate intuition to implicit cognition, emotions, scope insensitivity, expertise, and representative experimental design. In this article, we map intuition across poles such as Enlightenment/Romanticism, reason/emotion, objectivity/subjectivity, inferences/qualia, Taylorism/universal scholarship, System 2/System 1, dichotomies/dialectics, and science/art. We discuss intuitions as inspirations, instincts, inferences, and insights. Finally, we review the contributions to this special issue, placing them into historical, philosophical, and societal contexts. (C) 2015 Society for Applied Research in Memory and Cognition.

AB Cognitive architectures (e.g., ACT-R) have not traditionally been used to understand intuitive decision-making; instead, models tend to be designed with the intuitions of their modelers already hardcoded in the decision process. This is due in part to a fuzzy boundary between automatic and deliberative processes within the architecture. We argue that instance-based learning satisfies the conditions for intuitive decision-making described in Kahneman and Klein (2009), separates automatic from deliberative processes, and provides a general mechanism for the study of intuitive decision-making. To better understand the role of the environment in decision-making, we describe biases as arising from three sources: the mechanisms and limitations of the human cognitive architecture, the information structure in the task environment, and the use of heuristics and strategies to adapt performance to the dual constraints of cognition and environment. A unified decision-making model performing multiple complex reasoning tasks is described according to this framework. (C) 2014 Society for Applied Research in Memory and Cognition.

We argue that research on cognitive control has followed a similar path, and that the best approach toward unifying theories of cognitive control is that proposed by Newell, namely developing theories in computational cognitive architectures. Threaded cognition, a recent theory developed within the ACT-R cognitive architecture, offers promise as a unifying theory of cognitive control that addresses multitasking phenomena for both laboratory and applied task domains.

AB The main objective of the Synthetic Teammate project is to develop language and task enabled synthetic agents capable of being integrated into team training simulations. To achieve this goal, the agents must be able to closely match human behavior. The initial application for the synthetic teammate research is creation of an agent able to perform the functions of a pilot for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) simulation as part of a three-person team. The agent, or synthetic teammate, is being developed in the ACT-R cognitive architecture. The major components include: language comprehension and generation, dialog management, agent-environment interaction, and situation assessment. Initial empirical results suggest that the agent-environment interaction is a good approximation to human behavior in the UAV environment, and we are planning further empirical tests of the synthetic teammate operating with human teammates. This paper covers the project's modeling approach, challenges faced, progress made toward an integrated synthetic teammate, and lessons learned during development.

AB Humans use their spatial information processing abilities flexibly to facilitate problem solving and decision making in a variety of tasks. This article explores the question of whether a general strategy can be adapted for performing two different spatial orientation tasks by testing the predictions of a computational cognitive model. Human performance was measured on an orientation task requiring participants to identify the location of a target either on a map (find-on-map) or within an egocentric view of a space (find-in-scene). A general strategy instantiated in a computational cognitive model of the find-on-map task, based on the results from Gunzelmann and Anderson (2006), was adapted to perform both tasks and used to generate performance predictions for a new study. The qualitative fit of the model to the human data supports the view that participants were able to tailor a general strategy to the requirements of particular spatial tasks. The quantitative differences between the predictions of the model and the performance of human participants in the new experiment expose individual differences in sample populations. The model provides a means of accounting for those differences and a framework for understanding how human spatial abilities are applied to naturalistic spatial tasks that involve reasoning with maps.

AB Evaluating variations in the structure of computational models of cognition is as important as evaluating variations in the numerical parameters of such models. However, computational models tend not to be organized in such a way as to directly support such research. To address this need, we have taken the well-known cognitive architecture ACT-R, reduced it to its fundamental components, and reconstructed it. Our new system, Python ACT-R, facilitates exploration of the space of possible models and architectures based on the core ACT-R theory. The result has enabled us to examine the possibility of using basic ACT-R components such as the declarative memory system in new ways; for example, as the basis for a new visual attention system. Python ACT-R allows the same model de. nition syntax to be used to de. ne both ACT-R models and new ACT-R components, as well as making explicit the processes speci. fied by the ACT-R theory.

AB We describe concepts to support the analysis of cell phone menu hierarchies, based on cognitive models of users and easy-to-use optimization techniques. We present an empirical study of user performance on five simple tasks of menu traversal on an example cell phone. Two of the models applied to these tasks, based on GOMS and ACT-R, give good predictions of behavior. We use the empirically supported models to create an effective evaluation and improvement process for menu hierarchies. Our work makes three main contributions: a novel and timely study of a new, very common HCI task; new versions of existing models for accurately predicting performance; and a search procedure to generate menu hierarchies that reduce traversal time, in simulation studies, by about a third.

AB Small variations in how a task is designed can lead humans to trade off one set of strategies for another. In this paper we discuss our failure to model such tradeoffs in the Blocks World task using ACT-R's default mechanism for selecting the best production among competing productions. ACT-R's selection mechanism, its expected value equation, has had many successes (see, for example [Anderson, J. R., & Lebiere, C. (Eds.). (1998). Atomic components of thought. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.]) and a recognized strength of this approach is that, across a wide variety of tasks, it tends to produce models that adapt to their task environment about as fast as humans adapt. (This congruence with human behavior is in marked contrast to other popular ways of computing the utility of alternative choices; for example, Reinforcement Learning or most Connectionist learning methods.) We believe that the failure to model the Blocks World task stems from the requirement in ACT-R that all actions must be counted as a binary success or failure. In Blocks World, as well as in many other circumstances, actions can be met with mixed success or partial failure. Working within ACT-R's expected value equation we replace the binary success/failure judgment with three variations on a scalar one. We then compare the performance of each alternative with ACT-R's default scheme and with the human data. We conclude by discussing the limits and generality of our attempts to replace ACT-R's binary scheme with a scalar credit assignment mechanism. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We explore the utility of functional Near Infra Red (fNIR) technology in providing both empirical support and a basis for assessing and predicting dynamic changes in cognitive workload within the theoretical context of computational cognitive modeling (CCM). CCM has had many successes and in recent years has expanded from a tool for basic research to one that can tackle more complex real-world tasks. As a tool for basic research it seeks to provide a model of cognitive functionality; as a tool for cognitive engineering it seeks applications in monitoring and predicting real-time performance. With this powerful theoretical tool we combine the empirical power of fNIR technology. The fNIR technology is used to non-invasively monitor regional hemodynamic activities, namely blood volume changes and oxygenation dynamics.
   We examined a simple auditory classification task in four different workload conditions. We monitored the blood activity in the prefrontal cortex region of the frontal lobe during the performance of the task to assess the patterns of activity as workload changes. We associated patterns of model activity with patterns of the hemodynarnic data. We used ACT-R for creating the computational cognitive model. For the fNIR analysis, we used a generalized linear regression model along with time series clustering. We found that in the highest workload condition the model predicts a cognitive,overload', which correlated well with the fNIR cluster and classification analysis, as this condition differs significantly from the other three conditions. Linear regression on a subset of the data where workload increases monotonically shows that apart from the overload condition, there was a positive relationship between increase in workload and increase in blood volume activation. In addition, individual variations in hemodynamic response suggest that individuals differ in how they process different workload levels.

AB A model of humans playing the simple game of Paper Rock Scissors based on the ACT-R architecture (Anderson, 1993; Anderson & Lebiere, 1998) is presented. This model stores in long-term memory sequences of moves and attempts to anticipate the opponent's moves by retrieving from memory the most active sequence. This results in a tightly linked dynamical system in which each player drives the play of its opponent. The performance of this model as a function of the length of the sequences stored and the amount of noise in the system is investigated, and is compared to the performance of human subjects.

AB This paper compares the Act-R and Soar cognitive architectures, focusing on their theories of control. Act-R treats control (conflict resolution) as an automatic process, whereas Soar treats it as a potentially deliberate, knowledge-based process. The comparison reveals that Soar can model extremely flexible control, but has difficulty accounting for probabilistic operator selection and the independent effects of history and distance to goal on the likelihood of selecting an operator. In contrast, Act-R's control is well supported by empirical data, but has difficulty modeling task-switching, multiple interleaved tasks, and dynamic abandoning of subgoals. The comparison also reveals that many of the justifications for each architecture's control structure, such as some forms of flexible control and satisficing, are just as easily handled by both.

AB In laboratory and applied learning experiments, researchers have extensively investigated the optimal distribution of two learning sessions (i.e., initial learning and one relearning session) for the learning of verbatim materials. However, research has not yet provided a satisfying and conclusive answer to the optimal scheduling of three learning sessions (i.e., initial learning and two relearning sessions) across educationally relevant time intervals. Should the to-be-learned material be repeated at decreasing intervals (contracting schedule), constant intervals (equal schedule), or increasing intervals (expanding schedule) between learning sessions? Different theories and memory models (e.g., study-phase retrieval theory, contextual variability theory, ACT-R, and the Multiscale Context Model) make distinct predictions about the optimal learning schedule. We discuss the extant theories and derive clear predictions from each of them. To test these predictions empirically, we conducted an experiment in which participants studied and restudied paired associates with a contracting, equal, or expanding learning schedule. Memory performance was assessed immediately, 1 day, 7 days, or 35 days later with free- and cued-recall tests. Our results revealed that the optimal learning schedule is conditional on the length of the retention interval: A contracting learning schedule was beneficial for retention intervals up to 7 days, but both equal and expanding learning schedules were better for a long retention interval of 35 days. Our findings can be accommodated best by the contextual variability theory and indicate that revisions are needed to existing memory models. Our results are practically relevant, and their implications for real-world learning are discussed.

AB This paper presents a study of the effect of working memory load on the interpretation of pronouns in different discourse contexts: stories with and without a topic shift. We discuss a computational model (in ACT-R, Anderson, 2007) to explain how referring expressions are acquired and used. On the basis of simulations of this model, it is predicted that WM constraints only affect adults' pronoun resolution in stories with a topic shift, but not in stories without a topic shift. This latter prediction was tested in an experiment. The results of this experiment confirm that WM load reduces adults' sensitivity to discourse cues signaling a topic shift, thus influencing their interpretation of subsequent pronouns.

AB In Multiple investigations of human performance on natural tasks in three-dimensional (3D) environments, we have found that a sense of space is necessary for accurate modeling of human perception and motor planning. In previous work, we developed ACT-R/DHM, a modification of the ACT-R cognitive architecture with specific extensions for integration with 3D environments. ACT-R/DHM could leverage existing extensions from the ACTR community that implement the spatial sense, but current research seems to indicate that an "egocentric-first" approach is most appropriate. We describe the implementation of a custom spatial module in ACT-R/DHM, which allows for the consideration of spatial locations by adding a single ACT-R module that performs a very small set of operations on existing location information. We demonstrate the use of the 3D, egocentric-first spatial module to simulate a machine interaction task.

We investigated the characteristics of long-term, symbolic learning using the Soar and ACT-R cognitive architectures running cognitive models of two simple tasks. Long sequences of problems were run collecting data to answer fundamental questions about long-term, symbolic learning. We examined whether symbolic learning continues inde. finitely, how the learned knowledge is used, and whether computational performance degrades over the long term. We report three. findings. First, in both systems, symbolic learning eventually stopped. Second, learned knowledge was used diff. erently in different stages but the resulting production knowledge was used uniformly. Finally, both Soar and ACT-R do eventually suffer from degraded computational performance with long-term continuous learning. We also discuss ACT-R implementation and theoretic causes of ACT-R's computational performance problems and settings that appear to avoid the performance problems in ACT-R. Published by Elsevier B.

AB Previous research [Fisher, D. L., & Tan, K. C. (1989). Visual displays: The highlighting paradox. Human Factors, 31(1), 17-30] suggested that making certain items visually salient, or highlighting, can speed performance in visual search tasks. But interface designers cannot always anticipate users' intended targets, and highlighting non-target items can lead to performance decrements. An experiment presented suggests that people attend to highlighting less than what an algebraic visual search model of highlighted displays [Fisher, D. L., Coury, B. G., Tengs, T. O., & Du. y, S. A. (1989). Minimizing the time to search visual displays: The role of highlighting. Human Factors, 31(2), 167-182] predicts.

AB When people search a set of Web labels for links that are relevant to their information goal, they attend to the labels and estimate the likelihood that the link will lead to the goal. Recent findings indicate that people sometimes, but not always, assess only a subset of the links available. We report an ACT-R model of Web-page search that was inspired by Young's (1998) rational account of exploratory choice, but which was also sensitive to the psychological constraints encoded in the ACT-R theory of the human cognitive architecture. The behavior of the model differs substantially from previous ACT-R models of Web navigation, at least for single-page search. We describe an experimental test of the models behavior and qualitative and quantitative fits of the model to the data.

AB PRP (Psychological Refractory Period) is a basic but important form of human information processing in dual-task situations. This article describes a queuing network model of PRP that successfully modeled PRP without the need of setting up complex lock/unlock performance strategies employed in the EPIC model of PRP or drawing complex scheduling charts employed in the ACT-R/PM model of PRP. Further, by integrating queuing networks with reinforcement learning algorithms, the queuing network model successfully simulated practice effect on PRP, which has not been modeled in existing PRP models. The current research indicates that depending on an individual's degree of practice, cognition can be either serial or parallel at the level of production or response selection. Extensions of queuing network model in modeling other tasks and its easiness in modeling concurrent tasks in practice are also discussed.

AB Inhibition in set switching is inferred from so-called n-2 repetition costs: slower response times to ABA sequences compared to CBA sequences (where A, B, and C are arbitrary labels for different tasks). These costs are thought to reflect the persisting inhibition of task A when it was disengaged recently (as is the case in an ABA sequence). In this study we were interested in whether more inhibition may be required when the tasks are relatively novel. To this end, we examined the effect of practice on the n-2 repetition cost in nine participants across five experimental sessions, with 1222 trials performed in each session. The results show a clear reduction in the n-2 repetition cost, being altogether absent from the final sessions. Such a reduction is predicted by both: (a) a recent computational model of the n-2 repetition cost (Grange, Juvina, & Houghton, 2013) due to the gradual strengthening of task-related memory elements with practice to the point where inhibition has less impact; and (b) prior work showing smaller n-2 repetition costs with greater cue-target association strength (Houghton, Pritchard, & Grange, 2009). In this paper, we integrate these two theoretical derivations by extending our computational model, which fit the current data at the mean level, block level, and individual-subject (i.e., individual differences) level well.

AB Current computational cognitive architectures lack a comprehensive representation of human physiology. Connecting a more realistic model of physiology to a cognitive architecture allows one to develop more realistic computational process models that include an account for the effect of physiology on cognition. It is also useful to include some theory of affect and emotion to act as a functional layer between some representations of physiology and cognition. We chose to extend the ACT-R (adaptive control of thought - rational) cognitive architecture with physiology and affect to make the ACT-R Phi hybrid architecture. We connected the Hum Mod physiological simulation system with the ACT-R architecture; ACT-R Phi has a module that communicates between ACT-R and Hum Mod. A new affect system was also developed using an existing theoretical framework to serve as a functional layer between some of the physiological and cognitive representations. With this new architecture one can model a wide range of human behavior (e.g., the effects of homeostasis on cognition) in a more tractable fashion. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel explanation of belief bias in relational reasoning is presented based on the role of working memory and retrieval in deductive reasoning, and the influence of prior knowledge on this process. It is proposed that belief bias is caused by the believability of a conclusion in working memory which influences its activation level, determining its likelihood of retrieval and therefore its effect on the reasoning process. This theory explores two main influences of belief on the activation levels of these conclusions. First, believable conclusions have higher activation levels and so are more likely to be recalled during the evaluation of reasoning problems than unbelievable conclusions, and therefore, they have a greater influence on the reasoning process. Secondly, prior beliefs about the conclusion have a base level of activation and may be retrieved when logically irrelevant, influencing the evaluation of the problem. The theory of activation and memory is derived from the Atomic Components of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) cognitive architecture and so this account is formalized in an ACT-R cognitive model. Two experiments were conducted to test predictions of this model. Experiment 1 tested strength of belief and Experiment 2 tested the impact of a concurrent working memory load. Both of these manipulations increased the main effect of belief overall and in particular raised belief-based responding in indeterminately invalid problems. These effects support the idea that the activation level of conclusions formed during reasoning influences belief bias. This theory adds to current explanations of belief bias by providing a detailed specification of the role of working memory and how it is influenced by prior knowledge.

AB This paper presents two cognitive models that simulate the production of referring expressions in the iMAP taska task-oriented dialog. One general model is based on Dale and Reiters (1995)incremental algorithm, and the other is a simple template model that has a higher correlation with the data but is specifically geared toward the properties of the iMAP task. The property of the iMAP task environment that is modeled here is that the color feature is unreliable for identifying referents while other features are reliable. The low computational cost of the incremental algorithm for generating referring expressions makes it an interesting starting point for a cognitive model. However, its explanatory power is limited, because it generates uniquely distinguishing referring expressions and because it considers features for inclusion in the referring expression in a fixed order. The first model extends the original incremental algorithm by an ability to adapt to feedback of whether a referring expression was used successfully, but it seems to overpredict the frequency with which distinguishing expressions are made and underpredict the frequency of overspecified referring expressions. The second model produces features for referring expressions purely based on its current estimate of a features utility. Both models predict the observed human behavior of decreasing use of color terms and increasing use of useful feature terms.

AB Reasoning about and with time has never been studied extensively in the context of cognitive architectures. We present a temporal reasoning system that can make accurate predictions for two classic interval estimation experiments by Rakitin et al. (1998) and Penney et al. (2000). The system is implemented as an additional module for ACT-R. In combination with ACT-R's other mechanisms, it makes accurate predictions about experiments that go beyond just estimating time. We demonstrate this by modeling data from a choice-reaction task by GrosJean et al. (2001).

AB Individuals with agrammatic Broca's aphasia experience difficulty when processing reversible non-canonical sentences. Different accounts have been proposed to explain this phenomenon. The Trace Deletion account (Grodzinsky, 1995, 2000, 2006) attributes this deficit to an impairment in syntactic representations, whereas others (e.g., Caplan, Waters, Dede, Michaud, & Reddy, 2007; Haarmann, Just, & Carpenter, 1997) propose that the underlying structural representations are unimpaired, but sentence comprehension is affected by processing deficits, such as slow lexical activation, reduction in memory resources, slowed processing and/or intermittent deficiency, among others. We test the claims of two processing accounts, slowed processing and intermittent deficiency, and two versions of the Trace Deletion Hypothesis (TDH), in a computational framework for sentence processing (Lewis & Vasishth, 2005) implemented in ACT-R (Anderson, Byrne, Douglass, Lebiere, & Qin, 2004). The assumption of slowed processing is operationalized as slow procedural memory, so that each processing action is performed slower than normal, and intermittent deficiency as extra noise in the procedural memory, so that the parsing steps are more noisy than normal. We operationalize the TDH as an absence of trace information in the parse tree. To test the predictions of the models implementing these theories, we use the data from a German sentencepicture matching study reported in Hanne, Sekerina, Vasishth, Burchert, and De Bleser (2011). The data consist of offline (sentence-picture matching accuracies and response times) and online (eye fixation proportions) measures. From among the models considered, the model assuming that both slowed processing and intermittent deficiency are present emerges as the best model of sentence processing difficulty in aphasia. The modeling of individual differences suggests that, if we assume that patients have both slowed processing and intermittent deficiency, they have them in differing degrees.

AB In the processing of subject-verb agreement, non-subject plural nouns following a singular subject sometimes "attract" the agreement with the verb, despite not being grammatically licensed to do so. This phenomenon generates agreement errors in production and an increased tendency to fail to notice such errors in comprehension, thereby providing a window into the representation of grammatical number in working memory during sentence processing. Research in this topic, however, is primarily done in related languages with similar agreement systems. In order to increase the cross-linguistic coverage of the processing of agreement, we conducted a self-paced reading study in Modern Standard Arabic. We report robust agreement attraction errors in relative clauses, a configuration not particularly conducive to the generation of such errors for all possible lexicalizations. In particular, we examined the speed with which readers retrieve a subject controller for both grammatical and ungrammatical agreeing verbs in sentences where verbs are preceded by two NPs, one of which is a local non-subject NP that can act as a distractor for the successful resolution of subject-verb agreement. Our results suggest that the frequency of errors is modulated by the kind of plural formation strategy used on the attractor noun: nouns which form plurals by suffixation condition high rates of attraction, whereas nouns which form their plurals by internal vowel change (ablaut) generate lower rates of errors and reading-time attraction effects of smaller magnitudes. Furthermore, we show some evidence that these agreement attraction effects are mostly contained in the right tail of reaction time distributions. We also present modeling data in the ACT-R framework which supports a view of these ablauting patterns wherein they are differentially specified for number and evaluate the consequences of possible representations for theories of grammar and parsing.

AB An intelligent tutoring system plays vital role in education and its importance is constantly increasing, meanwhile the key challenge in the teaching learning process is assessing students' learning efficiently. In this paper, a hybrid assessment based-on ACT-R cognitive learning theory, combining ontology knowledge map with skills is proposed. In order to assess how well students master knowledge structure, an ontology knowledge map is constructed to describe declarative knowledge; and in order to assess how well students master knowledge skills, a problem solving process is constructed to describe procedural knowledge based on ACT-R. Finally, a student's mastery of knowledge is assessed through both the knowledge map and skills in the problem solving process, as well as auxiliary indicators like time usage, prior knowledge level, self-assessment, etc. This method is implemented in a geometric intelligent assessment system and is evaluated in a junior high school. Experiments show that the assessment results are consistent with students' actual learning levels. The hybrid cognitive assessment method can not only obtain the score of students' mastery of knowledge points and the structure through knowledge map, but also assess the learning skills in problem solving process through exercises quantitatively.

AB here can be systematic biases in time estimation when it is performed in complex multitasking situations. In this paper we focus on the mechanisms that cause participants to tend to respond too quickly and underestimate a target interval (250-400 ms) in a complex, real-time task. We hypothesized that two factors are responsible for the too-early bias: (1) Memory contamination from an even shorter time interval in the task, and (2) time pressure to take appropriate actions in time. In a simpler experiment that was focused on just these two factors, we found a strong too-early bias when participants estimated the target interval in alternation with a shorter interval and when they had little time to perform the task. The too-early bias was absent when they estimated the target interval in isolation without contamination and time pressure. A strong too-late bias occurred when the target interval alternated with a longer interval and there was no time pressure to respond. The effects were captured by incorporating the timing model of Taatgen and van Rijn (2011) into the ACT-R model for the Space Fortress task (Bothell, 2010). The results show that to properly understand time estimation in a dynamic task one needs to model the multiple influences that are occurring from the surrounding context. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB A dynamic context model of interactive behavior was developed to explain results from two experiments that tested the effects of interaction costs on encoding strategies, cognitive representations, and response selection processes in a decision-making and a judgment task. The model assumes that the dynamic context defined by the mixes of internal and external representations and processes are sensitive to the interaction cost imposed by the task environment. The model predicts that changes in the dynamic context may lead to systematic biases in cognitive representations and processes that eventually influence decision-making and judgment outcomes. Consistent with the predictions by the model, results from the experiments showed that as interaction costs increased, encoding strategies and cognitive representations shifted from perception-based to memory-based. Memory-based comparisons of the stimuli enhanced the similarity and dominance effects, and led to stronger systematic biases in response outcomes in a choice task. However, in a judgment task, memory-based representations enhanced only the dominance effects. Results suggested that systematic response biases in the dominance context were caused by biases in the cognitive representations of the stimuli, but response biases in the similarity context were caused by biases in the comparison process induced by the choice task. Results suggest that changes in interaction costs not only change whether information was assessed from the external world or from memory but also introduce systematic biases in the cognitive representation of the information, which act as biased inputs to the subsequent decision-making and judgment processes. Results are consistent with the idea of interactive cognition, which proposes that representations and processes are contingent on the dynamic context defined by the information flow between the external task environment and internal cognition.

AB We simulate the evolution of a domain vocabulary in small communities. Empirical data show that human communicators can evolve graphical languages quickly in a constrained task (Pictionary), and that communities converge towards a common language. We propose that simulations of such cultural evolution incorporate properties of human memory (cue-based retrieval, learning, decay). A cognitive model is described that encodes abstract concepts with small sets of concrete, related concepts (directing), and that also decodes such signs (matching). Learning captures conventionalized signs. Relatedness of concepts is characterized by a mixture of shared and individual knowledge, which we sample from a text corpus. Simulations show vocabulary convergence of agent communities of varied structure, but idiosyncrasy in vocabularies of each dyad of models. Convergence is weakened when agents do not alternate between encoding and decoding, predicting the necessity of bi-directional communication. Convergence is improved by explicit feedback about communicative success. We hypothesize that humans seek out subtle clues to gauge success in order to guide their vocabulary acquisition.

AB ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought - Rational) is a theory and computational model of human cognitive architecture. It consists of a set of modules with their own buffers, each devoted to processing a different kind of information. A production rule in the core production system can be fired based on the chunks in these buffers and then it changes the chunks in the buffer of the related modules or the state of the related modules, which may leads to fire a new production rule and so on to generate the cognitive behavior. It has successfully predicted and explained a broad range of cognitive psychological phenomena and found applications in the human-computer interface and other areas (see http://act-r.psy.emu.edu) and may have potential applications in Web intelligence.
   In recent years, a series of fMRI experiments have been performed to explore the neural basis of cognitive architecture and to build a two-way bridge between the information processing model and fMRI. The patterns of the activations of brain areas corresponding to the buffers of the major modules in ACT-R were highly consistent across these experiments; and ACT-R has successfully predicted the Blood Oxygenation Level-Depend (BOLD) effect in these regions. The approach of ACT-R meets fMRI may shed light on the research of Web Intelligence (WI) meets Brain Informatics (BI).

ID VENTROMEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; DECISION-MAKING
AB A new interpretation for the results of several experiments carried out using the Gambling Task paradigm is presented that differs from that put forward by Damasio (1994). While Damasio grounds his analysis on the somatic markers hypothesis, we propose a perspective based on the functional integration of emotion with memory that is sympathetic with the view of the prefrontal cortex endorsed by Rolls (1999, 2000). Our interpretation is supported by the development of a computational model implemented in the ACT-R cognitive architecture. The model highlights some limitations of the architecture that arise when dealing with situations charged with emotional significance. In particular, the model-when developed according to the standard ACT-R theory-produces a perseverating behavior that replicates the performance exhibited by participants with lesions in the orbitofrontal cortex. An adjustment to the ACT-R equations describing the activation of elements in declarative memory is suggested that allows modeling the performance of both normal controls and orbitofrontal patients.

AB In this paper, we describe an architectural modification to Soar that gives a Soar agent the opportunity to learn statistical information about the past success of its actions and utilize this information when selecting an operator. This mechanism serves the same purpose as production utilities in ACT-R, but the implementation is more directly tied to the standard definition of the reinforcement learning (RL) problem. The paper explains our implementation, gives a rationale for adding an RL capability to Soar, and shows results for Soar-RL agents' performance on two tasks.

AB It is the usual case in cognitive modeling that a model's output is compared to the average of a number of subjects, in which case the enterprise of modeling is apparently to capture the behavior of the typical individual. Our approach is to administer two simple tasks to each subject, using performance on those tasks as measures of individual ability. Those measures are then used as the values for parameters in an ACT-R model of a more complex task, so that the model can predict individual performance on that task.

AB This paper describes the modeling of human performance in a real-world, embodied, stochastic task: baseball batting. Experimental results were gathered in a virtual reality setup and a Markov model of performance, especially errors, was developed. The focus of this paper is on a model of the task developed in the ACT-R cognitive architecture, most specifically of the critical subtask of generating an expectation for the next pitch. The model required no parameter tuning and provides an a priori account of the results based on the architectural constraints of declarative memory. The Markov and ACT-R models are briefly compared. The broader relevance of the task is discussed and possible applications are suggested.

AB Working memory can be a major source of interference in dual tasking. However, there is no consensus on whether this interference is the result of a single working memory bottleneck, or of interactions between different working memory components that together form a complete working-memory system. We report a behavioral and an fMRI dataset in which working memory requirements are manipulated during multitasking. We show that a computational cognitive model that assumes a distributed version of working memory accounts for both behavioral and neuroimaging data better than a model that takes a more centralized approach. The model's working memory consists of an attentional focus, declarative memory, and a subvocalized rehearsal mechanism. Thus, the data and model favor an account where working memory interference in dual tasking is the result of interactions between different resources that together form a working memory system.

AB We describe the DSHM (Dynamically Structured Holographic Memory) model of human memory, which uses high dimensional vectors to represent items in memory. The complexity and intelligence of human behavior can be attributed, in part, to our ability to utilize vast knowledge acquired over a lifetime of experience with our environment. Thus models of memory, particularly models that can scale up to lifetime learning, are critical to modeling human intelligence. DHSM is based on the BEAGLE model of language acquisition (Jones Et Mewhort, 2007) and extends this type of model to general memory phenomena. We demonstrate that DHSM can model a wide variety of human memory effects. Specifically, we model the fan effect, the problem size effect (from math cognition), dynamic game playing (detecting sequential dependencies from memories of past moves), and time delay learning (using an instance based approach). This work suggests that DSHM is suitable as a basis for learning both over the shortterm and over the lifetime of the agent, and as a basis for both procedural and declarative memory. We argue that cognition needs to be understood at both the symbolic and sub-symbolic levels, and demonstrate that DSHM intrinsically operates at both of these levels of description. In order to situate DSHM in a familiar context, we discuss the relationship between DHSM and ACT-R. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Skill certification promotion is one of the main policies facilitated by the technological and vocational education, where application software instruction is regarded as the core curriculum to foster skill certification. With its close connection with problem-solving learning, application software instruction relies heavily on hands-on operation incorporating information technology to adequately unravel the challenges where living or working application is simulated as problem situations. According to Dewey (1963) and Edwards (1996), the process of reflection is characterized by the inference course where learners attempt to analyze and solve the problems. However, more evidence is needed to decide what reflective learning strategies are effective for students' learning. Application software operation is categorized as procedural knowledge. Repeated drills are requisite to reach the ultimate goal of spontaneous reaction without thinking. Features of CAL system offer a well-rounded environment to meet the demands. The purposes of this study were 1) to investigate how different reflective learning strategies can affect learning effectiveness of operational application software acquisition, 2) to identify effective learning strategies and to incorporate the CAL approach with instructional practices to foster learning performance. Aiming at characteristics of operational software, this study proposed operational software learning strategy theory model based on reflective learning and Adaptive Character of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) model theories. The proposed model modified the reflective learning theory and added cyclical loop into CAL to fit for operational software instruction. The CAL system is developed and incorporated into learning activities of reflective learning theory strategy model by collecting frequent operation errors made in the first-year experiment as the source drill items. This study is conducted in a two-year sequence. A total of 172 second-grade students was recruited from a vocational high school. Different reflective learning strategies, individual and group reflective learning strategy, are implemented on two experimental groups in the first year. CAL strategy is later added into the experimental groups in the second year. The results suggest that group reflective learning strategy can enhance learning effectiveness of the holistic and medium-score group students. When reflective learning strategy is incorporated with CAL, in addition to maintaining the first-year learning effectiveness, learning effectiveness of the holistic and low-score group students can be benefited by individual reflective learning strategy. Furthermore, reflective learning incorporating with CAL has greater learning effectiveness than the learning without CAL. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   cognitive robotics
AB Research in robotic systems has traditionally been identified with approaches that are characterized by the use of carefully crafted representations and processes to find optimal solutions. The use of such representations and processes, which we refer to as the algorithmic approach, is uniquely suited for problems requiring strong models, i.e., tasks and domains that are well defined, and/or involve close interaction with the environment. These problems have historically been the focus of robotics research because they exercise perceptual, motor and manipulation capabilities that form the basic foundational abilities required for every robotic agent. Recent work (for example ROS and Tekkotsu) on the abstraction and encapsulation of perception and motor functionality has standardized the above mentioned foundational abilities and allowed researchers to study problems in less clearly defined and open-ended domains: problems that have previously been considered the province of Al and Cognitive Science. In this paper, we argue that the study of these problems (examples of which include multi-agent interaction, instruction following and reasoning in complex domains) referred to under the rubric of Cognitive Robotics is best achieved via the use of cognitive architectures - unified computational frameworks developed specifically for general problem solving and human cognitive modeling. We lay out the relevant architectural concepts and principles and illustrate them using nine cognitive architectures that are under active development - Soar, ACT-R, CLARION, GMU-BICA, Polyscheme, Co-JACK, ADAPT, ACT-R/E, and SS-RICS.

AB An outstanding question in theoretical neuroscience is how the brain solves the neural binding problem. In vision, binding can be summarized as the ability to represent that certain properties belong to one object while other properties belong to a different object. I review the binding problem in visual and other domains, and review its simplest pro-posed solution the anatomical binding hypothesis. This hypothesis has traditionally been rejected as a true solution because it seems to require a type of one-to-one wiring of neurons that would be impossible in a biological system (as opposed to an engineered system like a computer). I show that this requirement for one-to-one wiring can be loosened by carefully considering how the neural representation is actually put to use by the rest of the brain. This leads to a solution where a symbol is represented not as a particular pattern of neural activation but instead as a piece of a global stable attractor state. I introduce the Dynamically Partitionable AutoAssociative Network (DPAAN) as an implementation of this solution and show how DPANNs can be used in systems which perform perceptual binding and in systems that implement syntax-sensitive rules. Finally I show how the core parts of the cognitive architecture ACT-R can be neurally implemented using a DPAAN as ACT-R's global workspace. Because the DPAAN solution to the binding problem requires only "flat" neural representations (as opposed to the phase encoded representation hypothesized in neural synchrony solutions) it is directly compatible with the most well developed neural models of learning, memory, and pattern recognition.

AB This paper focuses on the creation and presentation of a user-friendly experience for developing computational models of human behavior. Although computational models of human behavior have enjoyed a rich history in cognitive psychology, they have lacked widespread impact, partly due to the technical knowledge and programming required in addition to the complexities of the modeling process. We describe a modeling tool called IBLTool that is a computational implementation of the Instance-based Learning Theory (IBLT). IBLT is a theory that represents how decisions are made from experience in dynamic tasks. The IBLTool makes IBLT usable and understandable to a wider community of cognitive and behavioral scientists. The tool uses graphical user interfaces that take a modeler step-by-step through several IBLT processes and help the modeler derive predictions of human behavior in a particular task. A task would connect and interact with the IBLTool and store the decision-making data while the tool collects statistical data from the execution of a model for the task. We explain the functioning of the IBLTool and demonstrate a concrete example of the design and execution of a model for the Iowa Gambling task. The example is intended to provide a concrete demonstration of the capabilities of the IBLTool. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article presents an approach to understanding human spatial competence that focuses on the representations and processes of spatial cognition and how they are integrated with cognition more generally. The foundational theoretical argument for this research is that spatial information processing is central to cognition more generally, in the sense that it is brought to bear ubiquitously to improve the adaptivity and effectiveness of perception, cognitive processing, and motor action. We describe research spanning multiple levels of complexity to understand both the detailed mechanisms of spatial cognition, and how they are utilized in complex, naturalistic tasks. In the process, we discuss the critical role of cognitive architectures in developing a consistent account that spans this breadth, and we note some areas in which the current version of a popular architecture, ACT-R, may need to be augmented. Finally, we suggest a framework for understanding the representations and processes of spatial competence and their role in human cognition generally.

AB The study of cognition is generally thought to rely on techniques for inferring cognitive processes that are unobservable. One approach to cognitive science is to leverage an understanding of structure and function of the nervous system based on observable neurological events to determine mental processing. Event-related potential (ERP) research offers one technique to objectively measure cortical responses that are believed to be associated with perceptual and cognitive processes. Here, two ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought - Rational) models of mental processing are adapted based on the results of two ERP experiments. The models provide both a sequence of mental steps required to complete each task and a greater specificity of time course of mental events than traditional ACTR models. We conclude with implications of this research for cognitive theory and ACT-R as well as future work to be conducted. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper describes a practicing method for enhancing driver performance, which it bases on cognitive driver behavior model of ACT-R--a dominant theory of human cognitive architecture. First, the paper elaborates the idea of driver behavior modeling in cognitive architecture. And then, it dedicates the implementation of driver's practice courses based on the cognitive architecture model. Finally, by comparing the experiments back and forth of the practice, the results indicate that the practice based on driver cognitive behavior model can improve the driver performances positively. The experiences of the practice also implied that both practice method is indeed an approach worthy of pursuit for enhancing driver performance at driving emergencies and driver behavior modeling in cognitive architecture is a substantial tool for practical applications in predicting and instructing driver behaviors.

AB Model validation in computational cognitive psychology often relies on methods drawn from the testing of theories in experimental physics. However, applications of these methods to computational models in typical cognitive experiments can hide multiple, plausible sources of variation arising from human participants and from stochastic cognitive theories, encouraging a model fixed, data variable paradigm that makes it difficult to interpret model predictions and to account for individual differences. This article proposes a likelihood-based, data fixed, model variable paradigm in which models are treated as stochastic processes in experiments with participant-to-participant variation that can be applied to a broad range of mechanistic cognitive architectures. This article discusses the implementation and implications of this view in model validation, with a concrete focus on a simple class of ACT-R models of cognition. This article is not intended as a recipe for broad application of these preliminary, proof-of-concept methods, but as a framework for communication between statisticians searching for interesting problems in the cognitive modeling sphere, and cognitive modelers interested in generalizing from deterministic to stochastic model validation, in the face of random variation in human experimental data.

AB Modeling of individual or group diff. erences, believed to be a powerful test for computational models, is still rare in current cognitive science. In this paper, we discuss alternative approaches to the computational modeling of both qualitative and quantitative differences among individuals as well as groups of individuals. Then, an example is presented of how accounting for individual differences in short term memory (STM) search can bring us insight into cognitive processes underlying this phenomenon, insight that otherways would be impossible. The two-phase computational model of memory search implements the idea of working memory (WM) focus of attention (FA): due to updating process a few items may be actively kept and easily accessed in ACT-R goal buffer. FA is being scanned serially first, and if the scan result is negative, a parallel chunk retrieval from active part of declarative memory outside the FA may run with certain probability. The model aptly simulates steep decrease in accuracy as well as steep increase in latency for responses to five most recent stimuli. The model also predicts the observed e. ffect of faster negative responses than positive responses to less recent stimuli. Most important, with manipulation to only one of its parameters (i. e., the capacity of FA) our model is able to predict 94% of variance for two groups of participants that differed in latency patterns (i. e., 'serial-like' vs. 'parallel-like' groups) of the search process.

AB Cognitive architectures-task-general theories of the structure and function of the complete cognitive system-are sometimes argued to be more akin to frameworks or belief systems than scientific theories. The argument stems from the apparent non-falsifiability of existing cognitive architectures. Newell was aware of this criticism and argued that architectures should be viewed not as theories subject to Popperian falsification, but rather as Lakatosian research programs based on cumulative growth. Newell's argument is undermined because he failed to demonstrate that the development of Soar, his own candidate architecture, adhered to Lakatosian principles. This paper presents detailed case studies of the development of two cognitive architectures, Soar and ACT-R, from a Lakatosian perspective. It is demonstrated that both are broadly Lakatosian, but that in both cases there have been theoretical progressions that, according to Lakatosian criteria, are pseudo-scientific. Thus, Newell's defense of Soar as a scientific rather than pseudo-scientific theory is not supported in practice. The ACT series of architectures has fewer pseudo-scientific progressions than Soar, but it too is vulnerable to accusations of pseudo-science. From this analysis, it is argued that successive versions of theories of the human cognitive architecture must explicitly address five questions to maintain scientific credibility.

AB The integration of cognitive models offers interesting theoretical and practical benefits to the development of complex models, but at the same time brings up new challenges that the modeling community is only beginning to address. In this paper we present our experiences integrating models and tools for modeling,. Specifically, on the modeling end, we integrated an ACT-R model of driving with an independently-built model of cell phone dialing. To do this, we integrated the driving tool (a minimal-graphics driving simulator that can be controlled by ACT-R) with a modeling-by-demonstration tool, CogTool, that also used ACT-R as its cognitive engine. We found that both the models and tools required re-working because of the integration. The models required new motor movements and methods for switching between tasks. The tools required new specification techniques for placing prototyped devices in the vehicle and demonstration techniques for indicating points of task-switching. Our experiences indicate that while the integration of cognitive models is indeed an approach worthy of pursuit, the field may not understand all the ramifications of such integration until many more integrated models and tools are developed.

AB While computational cognitive modeling has made great strides in addressing complex dynamic tasks, the modeling of individual differences in complex tasks remains a largely unexplored area of research. In this paper we present a straightforward approach to modeling individual differences, specifically age-related cognitive differences, in complex tasks, and illustrate the application of this approach in the domain of driving. We borrow ideas from rigorous work in the EPIC cognitive architecture (Meyer et al., 2001) and extend them to the ACT-R architecture (Anderson et al., in press) and a recently-developed ACT-R driver model (Salvucci, Boer, & Liu, 2001) to model the effects of age on driver behavior. We describe two validation studies that demonstrate how this approach accounts for two important age-related effects on driver performance, namely effects on lateral stability and brake response during both normal driving and driving while performing a secondary task.

AB This paper describes a cognitive architecture to evaluate visualization applications (CAEVA). This architecture requires gathering domain knowledge to adapt existing evaluation models to new domains and applications. This architecture has two main components: one for interoperability and one for cognitive models. The interoperability component uses client-server protocols. The cognitive component includes three subcomponents: knowledge about visualization, knowledge about the data domain, and knowledge about data analysis strategies.
   CAEVA was used to evaluate the visualizations generated to compare environmental products. The cognitive model is written in ACT-R and simulates how human beings use visualizations to perform data analysis tasks.
   The data produced by the simulation model is validated with empirical data obtained from human subjects performing the same task. The simulation model produces traces that allow researchers to analyze the strategies followed by the users in the task. The data produced by the model allowed us to study the teaming process of visualization users.

AB The present experiment aimed at studying the resolution of simple additions and multiplications in fifth-graders. The operations were those including two digits (2 to 9), except ties. The task was operation verification. The results showed that the operands' size effect and the priming effect of the sign were greater for addition than for multiplication. The results suggested that multiplication is solved by a direct retrieval of the answer from memory, whereas addition is solved by, an algorithmic strategy. These results replicate those found by Roussel, Fayol and Barrouillet (2001) in adults, and are discussed in the scope of the ACT-R model (Anderson, 1993). Finally, this study suggested that, except for an increase of speed, the nature of the strategies used to solve simple additions and multiplications does not change with development.

AB This paper attempts to draw a bridge between psychophysics and memory research by proposing a memory-based model of category rating. The model is based on the cognitive architecture ACT-R and uses anchors stored in memory that serve as prototypes for the stimuli classified within a response category. The anchors are retrieved by a partial matching mechanism and updated dynamically by an incremental learning mechanism. Anchors also have baselevel activations that reflect the frequency and recency of the responses. These mechanisms give rise to sequential effects and nonuniform response distributions. A psychological experiment involving category rating of physical length is reported and the predictions of the model are compared against the empirical data. The psychophysical implications of the model are discussed.

AB In this paper we show that adaptivity is reduced when people become fatigued. Fatigued people adapt worse to changing probability distributions as compared to non-fatigued individuals. In an ACT-R model of the task we show that this decreased adaptivity is due to a decrease in the use of one specific strategy. We argue that the use of this strategy is decreased, because it places high demands on working memory. In previous research we also found indications that mental fatigue is related to changes in working memory functioning. We argue that modeling individual differences in performance will provide better insight in the processes involved in mental fatigue.

AB We introduce a method for measuring the number and durations of processing stages from the electroencephalographic signal and apply it to the study of associative recognition. Using an extension of past research that combines multivariate pattern analysis with hidden semi-Markov models, the approach identifies on a trial-by-trial basis where brief sinusoidal peaks (called bumps) are added to the ongoing electroencephalographic signal. We propose that these bumps mark the onset of critical cognitive stages in processing. The results of the analysis can be used to guide the development of detailed process models. Applied to the associative recognition task, the hidden semi-Markov models multivariate pattern analysis method indicates that the effects of associative strength and probe type are localized to a memory retrieval stage and a decision stage. This is in line with a previously developed the adaptive control of thought-rational process model, called ACT-R, of the task. As a test of the generalization of our method we also apply it to a data set on the Sternberg working memory task collected by Jacobs, Hwang, Curran, and Kahana (2006). The analysis generalizes robustly, and localizes the typical set size effect in a late comparison/decision stage. In addition to providing information about the number and durations of stages in associative recognition, our analysis sheds light on the event-related potential components implicated in the study of recognition memory.

AB This fMRI study examines the changes in participants' information processing as they repeatedly solve the same mathematical problem. We show that the majority of practice-related speedup is produced by discrete changes in cognitive processing. Because the points at which these changes take place vary from problem to problem, and the underlying information processing steps vary in duration, the existence of such discrete changes can be hard to detect. Using two converging approaches, we establish the existence of three learning phases. When solving a problem in one of these learning phases, participants can go through three cognitive stages: Encoding, Solving, and Responding. Each cognitive stage is associated with a unique brain signature. Using a bottom-up approach combining multi-voxel pattern analysis and hidden semi-Markov modeling, we identify the duration of that stage on any particular trial from participants brain activation patterns. For our top-down approach we developed an ACT-R model of these cognitive stages and simulated how they change over the course of learning. The Solving stage of the first learning phase is long and involves a sequence of arithmetic computations. Participants transition to the second learning phase when they can retrieve the answer, thereby drastically reducing the duration of the Solving stage. With continued practice, participants then transition to the third learning phase when they recognize the problem as a single unit and produce the answer as an automatic response. The duration of this third learning phase is dominated by the Responding stage. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A challenge for most theoretical and computational accounts of linguistic reference is the observation that language users vary considerably in their referential choices. Part of the variation observed among and within language users and across tasks may be explained from variation in the cognitive resources available to speakers and listeners. This paper presents a computational model of reference production and comprehension developed within the cognitive architecture ACT-R. Through simulations with this ACT-R model, it is investigated how cognitive constraints interact with linguistic constraints and features of the linguistic discourse in speakers' production and listeners' comprehension of referring expressions in specific tasks, and how this interaction may give rise to variation in referential choice. The ACT-R model of reference explains and predicts variation among language users in their referential choices as a result of individual and task-related differences in processing speed and working memory capacity. Because of limitations in their cognitive capacities, speakers sometimes underspecify or overspecify their referring expressions, and listeners sometimes choose incorrect referents or are overly liberal in their interpretation of referring expressions.

AB Adding a physiological representation to a cognitive architecture offers an attractive approach to modeling the effects of stress on cognition. We introduce ACT-R/I broken vertical bar, an extended version of the ACT-R cognitive architecture that includes an integrative model of physiology. The extension allows the representation of how physiology and cognition interact. This substrate was used to represent potential effects of a startle response and task-based stress during a mental arithmetic (subtraction) task. We compare predictions from two models loaded into the new hybrid architecture to models previously developed within ACT-R. General behavior differed between models in that the ACT-R/I broken vertical bar models had dynamic declarative memory noise over the course of the task based on varying epinephrine levels. They attempted more subtractions but were less accurate; this more closely matched human performance than the previous ACT-R models. Using ACT-R/I broken vertical bar allows a more tractable integration of current physiological and cognitive perspectives on stress. ACT-R/I broken vertical bar also permits further exploration of the interaction between cognition and physiology, and the emergent effects on behavior caused by the interaction among physiological subsystems. This extension is useful for anyone exploring how the human mind can occur in and be influenced by the physical universe.

AB The article investigates how the various colors and color pairs used as grouping factors affect the visual search process and direct manipulation activities in the context of tailbar-like graphical panels. Red, green, and blue colors having the same perceptual distance in the CIELab space are used. The results demonstrate significant influence of the examined color-related factors on the speed and accuracy. The color preattentive property depends strongly on the grouping pattern: layouts with smaller colored areas were operated worse than panels divided into larger parts. Meaningful differences were also observed between panels with single and two colored backgrounds.
   Preferences were examined by pairwise comparisons before and after performing the 'search and select' tasks. Subjective judgments were significantly differentiated by the toolbar background color pattern both prior to the performance tasks and after them. The initial relative weights structure changed decidedly after the performance experience being more consistent with the 'search and select' results. The location factor was irrelevant for the speed and accuracy as well as for preferences. Objective and subjective findings are compared and discussed. Linear regression models showing the preference structure change and the relationship between mean acquisition times and mean preference weights are developed and discussed.

AB Free association is a task that requires a subject to express the first word to come to their mind when presented with a certain cue. It is a task which can be used to expose the basic mechanisms by which humans connect memories. In this work, we have made use of a publicly available database of free associations to model the exploration of the averaged network of associations using a statistical and the adaptive control of thought-rational (ACT-R) model. We performed, in addition, an online experiment asking participants to navigate the averaged network using their individual preferences for word associations. We have investigated the statistics of word repetitions in this guided association task. We find that the considered models mimic some of the statistical properties, viz the probability of word repetitions, the distance between repetitions and the distribution of association chain lengths, of the experiment, with the ACT-R model showing a particularly good fit to the experimental data for the more intricate properties as, for instance, the ratio of repetitions per length of association chains.

AB Information technologies have been developed to facilitate driving performance and improve safety. However, there is a lack of computational methods that can take into account drivers' adaptation to driving. That is, how behaviour changes with experience. Modelling the effect of driving experience on driver behaviour is important to the development of in-vehicle information technologies, because drivers at different skill levels may need different types or levels of assistance. Cognitive-architecture-based human performance modelling is a valuable method that can integrate different cognitive aspects underlying human behaviour such as skill levels and support quantitative simulation of behaviour. The study reported in this paper tested and examined computational models built in ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational) to account for the effect of driving experience on collision avoidance braking behaviour. The modelling results were compared with human data collected from a simulated driving experiment. The models produced braking behavioural results similar to the human results. Moreover, model predictions of three other emergent-braking scenarios were generally similar to and in the same order with the empirical results reported in previous studies. Future research can further integrate the method and results into intelligent driver assistance systems such as collision warning systems to better adjust the systems to the need of different drivers with different skill levels.

SO TOPICS IN COGNITIVE SCIENCE

ID DYNAMICS
AB During each school semester, students face an onslaught of material to be learned. Students work hard to achieve initial mastery of the material, but when they move on, the newly learned facts, concepts, and skills degrade in memory. Although both students and educators appreciate that review can help stabilize learning, time constraints result in a trade-off between acquiring new knowledge and preserving old knowledge. To use time efficiently, when should review take place? Experimental studies have shown benefits to long-term retention with spaced study, but little practical advice is available to students and educators about the optimal spacing of study. The dearth of advice is due to the challenge of conducting experimental studies of learning in educational settings, especially where material is introduced in blocks over the time frame of a semester. In this study, we turn to two established models of memory-ACT-R and MCM-to conduct simulation studies exploring the impact of study schedule on long-term retention. Based on the premise of a fixed time each week to review, converging evidence from the two models suggests that an optimal review schedule obtains significant benefits over haphazard (suboptimal) review schedules. Furthermore, we identify two scheduling heuristics that obtain near optimal review performance: (a) review the material from l-weeks back, and (b) review material whose predicted memory strength is closest to a particular threshold. The former has implications for classroom instruction and the latter for the design of digital tutors.

AB We explore the interaction between oculomotor control and language comprehension on the sentence level using two well-tested computational accounts of parsing difficulty. Previous work (Boston, Hale, Vasishth, & Kliegl, 2011) has shown that surprisal (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008) and cue-based memory retrieval (Lewis & Vasishth, 2005) are significant and complementary predictors of reading time in an eyetracking corpus. It remains an open question how the sentence processor interacts with oculomotor control. Using a simple linking hypothesis proposed in Reichle, Warren, and McConnell (2009), we integrated both measures with the eye movement model EMMA (Salvucci, 2001) inside the cognitive architecture ACT-R (Anderson et al., 2004). We built a reading model that could initiate short Time Out regressions (Mitchell, Shen, Green, & Hodgson, 2008) that compensate for slow postlexical processing. This simple interaction enabled the model to predict the re-reading of words based on parsing difficulty. The model was evaluated in different configurations on the prediction of frequency effects on the Potsdam Sentence Corpus. The extension of EMMA with postlexical processing improved its predictions and reproduced re-reading rates and durations with a reasonable fit to the data. This demonstration, based on simple and independently motivated assumptions, serves as a foundational step toward a precise investigation of the interaction between high-level language processing and eye movement control.

AB This paper is concerned with computational driver modeling, whereby a particular focus is placed on mapping both non-routine and routine elements of the driving task in a theoretically coherent framework. The approach is based on Salvucci's [1] driver model and thus, the cognitive architecture ACT-R [2] is used for modeling non-routine matters; for routine activities, such as the longitudinal and the lateral control of the vehicle, a fuzzy logic approach is Suggested. In order to demonstrate the applicability of this procedure, an empirical evaluation study is carried Out and the steering behavior of a computational driver model is compared to that of human drivers.

AB In this paper, we present an investigation on heuristics retrieval in human problem solving by combining the computational cognitive model ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational) and advanced fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) brain imaging technique. As a new paradigm, 4*4 Sudoku is developed to facilitate this study, in which seven heuristics that can be classified into 3 groups are designed to solve two types of tasks: simple and complex ones. The cognitive processes of the two types of 4*4 Sudoku tasks are explored based on the outputs of ACT-R model. This study shows that several key elements take important roles in the retrieval of heuristics, including the ways of problem presentation, complexity of heuristics and status of goal. The fitness of model prediction to real participants' data on behavior and BOLD (Blood Oxygenation Level-Dependent) response in five predefined brain regions illustrates that our hypotheses and results are acceptable. This work is a significant step towards tackling the puzzle of the heuristics retrieval in human brain.

This paper presents a cognitive software agent that is capable of compiling a tactical picture in the domain of Naval Anti-Surface Warfare. The agent is implemented in ACT-R and can perform this task in a simulated environment with a varying degree of quality, so it is usable for all the roles. The agent's behavior was evaluated in a session with military experts and although much work remains to be done, the research was positively evaluated.

AB This article describes the development of a real-time model-based training system that provides adaptive "over-the-shoulder" (OTS) instructions to trainees as they learn to perform an Anti-Air Warfare Coordinator (AAWC) task. The long-term goal is to develop a system that will provide real-time instructional materials based on learners' actions, so that eventually the initial set of instructions on a task can be strengthened, complemented, or overridden at different stages of training. The training system is based on the ACT-R architecture, which serves as the theoretical background for the cognitive model that monitors the learning process of the trainee. An experiment was designed to study the impact of OTS instructions on learning. Results showed that while OTS instructions facilitated short-term learning, (a) they took time away from the processing of current information, (b) their effects tended to decay rapidly in initial stages of training, and (c) their effects on training diminished when the OTS instructions were proceduralized in later stages of training. A cognitive model that learned from both the upfront and OTS instructions was created and provided good fits to the learning and performance data collected from human participants. Our results suggest that to fully capture the symbiotic performance between humans and intelligent training systems, it is important to closely monitor the learning process of the trainee so that instructional interventions can be delivered effectively at different stages of training. We proposed that such a flexible system can be developed based on an adaptive cognitive model that provides real-time predictions on learning and performance. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB The existing procedural learning mechanism in ACT-R (Anderson & Lebiere, 1998) has been successful in explaining a wide range of adaptive choice behavior. However, the existing mechanism is inherently limited to learning from binary feedback (i.e. whether a reward is received or not). It is thus difficult to capture choice behavior that is sensitive to both the probabilities of receiving a reward and the reward magnitudes. By modifying the temporal difference learning algorithm (Sutton & Barto, 1998), a new procedural learning mechanism is implemented that generalizes and extends the computational abilities of the current mechanism. Models using the new mechanism were fit to three sets of human data collected from experiments of probability learning and decision making tasks. The new procedural learning mechanism fit the data at least as well as the existing mechanism, and is able to fit data that are problematic for the existing mechanism. This paper also shows how the principle of reinforcement learning can be implemented in a production system like ACT-R.

AB Eye movement is a basic human behavior that offers a valuable means to explore human cognitive processes. This article introduces two modeling studies of eye movement. First, random menu search was modeled using a queueing network approach and second, a reinforcement learning algorithm was used to generate various eye movement patterns. Random menu search is a task component involved in many human-machine interfaces and has been modeled with several cognitive models including ACT-R and EPIC. Based upon review of empirical data in menu search, and strengths and limitations of existing models, this article proposes a queueing network model, which has been successfully applied in some other task domains (e.g., response time, driver performance). The queueing network model for random menu search was implemented and evaluated through model simulation. In contrast to existing models that rely on four task-specific strategies to account for data, the queueing network model accounted for the same data using only one strategy already employed in cognitive modeling. To extend this parsimonious, "minimal task strategy" modeling approach, Q-Learning, one of the reinforcement learning methods, was adopted to generate different patterns in eye movement. The same strategy from random menu search was used to generate eye movement, and the simulated eye movements were qualitatively compared to the human eye movement.

AB While cognitive models of complex tasks have begun to incorporate increasingly sophisticated models of human multitasking, most models have utilized customized executives (Kieras et al., 2000) that fine-tune specific multitasking mechanisms for particular applications. This paper proposes a general executive for multitasking that facilitates the integration of separate task models and subsequent prediction of the effects of multitasking and task interaction. Developed in the ACT-R cognitive architecture, the general executive is specified as a new goal module that orders goals by urgency and their own requested running times. The paper demonstrates the predictive power of the general executive in the driving domain by integrating separate models of control and monitoring and predicting drivers' gaze distributions across various regions of the driving environment.

ID MODEL
AB The data learning problem is a phenomenon that arises when an agent employing a cognitive architecture faces the task of acquiring declarative information from an external source, such as the "answer" to a "question". Because the agent has to pay attention to both question and answer in order to team the association between them, it is problematic for the agent to learn to produce the answer in response to the question alone. This observation helps shape the basic characteristics of human memory. The problem was first reported with the Soar architecture, but it arises also in ACT-R, and this paper argues that it will occur in any cognitive architecture, connectionist as well as symbolic, which is specified in a sufficiently explicit manner to avoid having the theorist act as an implicit homunculus for the agent.

AB Counting is an important activity because it gives rise to a whole range of arithmetic activities. Counting objects requires subjects to point at each object and to say the corresponding number-word. Furthermore, to determine the correct cardinal of a set, the two activities of pointing and saying must be synchronized. This perfect correspondence between the two activities is achieved by a coordination process. Using Camos et al.'s (2001) paradigm, the present study tested the hypothesis that this coordination process will induce its own cognitive cost and that this cost would decrease with age. Eight-year-old children and adults were asked to say the numberline from 1 to 23, from 61 to 83, and from 111 to 133. They also pointed at objects in arrays that did or did not include distracters. Finally, they counted objects in arrays with or without distracters using the numberline starting at 1, then at 61, and then at 111. In children, as in adults, the simultaneous increase in the attentional demand of the pointing (due to the distracters) and the saying (for the numberline starting at 61 or 111) affected counting performance. However, it never made coordination more difficult. The coordination process in counting thus has a negligible cost. Moreover, an unexpected facilitation effect was observed. Indeed, when the attentional demand of saying was high, the simultaneous production of pointing increased the performance in saying the numberline. In other words, a verbal activity was facilitated by a concurrent motor activity. The negligible cost of coordination and the facilitation effect were both explained by an early compilation of counting as defined in ACT-R (Anderson, 1983, 1993).

ID INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; WORKING-MEMORY
AB This research investigates the impact of time pressure and individual differences on learning in a Real-Time Dynamic Decision Making (RTDDM) task. Our empirical results indicate that high time pressure generates high cognitive loads inhibiting learning. The results also show that high time pressure have a differential impact on the learning of individuals with high or low Working Memory (WM) capacity. We present a cognitive model based on ACT-R intended to explain learning in this task. Our cognitive model simulates learning by recognizing regularities in the decision task, and building "chunks" that guide decision making (instance-based learning). We describe how the model will be used to explain the impact of time pressure and WM capacity by varying the number of chunks acquired by the system given alternative time pressure conditions and individual differences.

AB In this paper I will present a detailed ACT-R model of how the task-specific knowledge for a new, complex task is learned. The model is capable of acquiring its knowledge through experience, using a declarative representation that is gradually compiled into a procedural representation. The model exhibits several characteristics that concur with Fitts' and Anderson's theories of skill learning, and can be used to show that individual differences in working-memory capacity initially have a large impact on performance, but that this impact diminished after sufficient experience, which is consistent with Ackermans's theory of skill learning. Some preliminary experimental data support these findings.

AB Modelling human performance in complex tasks is progressing from lower-level architectures to now using cognitive architectures like ACT-R and Soar. Thee important differences between architectures include their capabilities for modelling human error. One can evaluate an architecture for modelling error by comparing observed types of error in real complex tasks with the potential mechanisms available in the architecture with which to model error. Anderson's ACT-R; Reason's fallible machine (underlying the COSIMO model); and Michael J. Young's Holon Cognitive Architecture (HCA) are here compared Conclusions are in terms of the outstanding changes for development of architecture towards being useful for models of human error in commercially important tasks, and towards greater ease for this evaluation.

AB In this study, we investigated the cognitive processing stages underlying associative recognition using MEG. Over the last four decades, a model of associative recognition has been developed in the ACT-R cognitive architecture. This model was first exclusively based on behavior, but was later evaluated and improved based on fMRI and EEG data. Unfortunately, the limited spatial resolution of EEG and the limited temporal resolution of fMRI have made it difficult to fully understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of associative recognition. We therefore conducted an associative recognition experiment with MEG, which combines excellent temporal resolution with reasonable spatial resolution. To analyze the data, we applied non-parametric cluster analyses and a multivariate classifier. This resulted in a detailed spatio-temporalmodel of associative recognition. After the visual encoding of the stimuli in occipital regions, three separable memory processes took place: a familiarity process (temporal cortex), a recollection process (temporal cortex and supramarginal gyrus), and a representational process (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). A late decision process (superior parietal cortex) then acted upon the recollected information represented in the prefrontal cortex, culminating in a late response process (motor cortex). We conclude that existing theories of associative recognition, including the ACT-R model, should be adapted to include these processes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Aggressive behavior is one of themost challenging symptomsin psychiatry, and biological markers for aggression lack of large sample validations. Serotonin (5-HT) and other neuroactive compounds deriving from Tryptophan (Trp), including kynurenine (Kyn), have not yet been investigated in large cohorts of aggressive individuals to validate their potential as biomarkers of aggression.
   In 361 male inmates we measured serum levels of Trp, 5-hydroxytryptophan, 5-HT, Kyn, the ratios 5-HT/Trp (*) 1000 and Kyn/Trp (*) 1000, and performed Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis-I and -II Disorders (SCID-I and -II), global assessment of functioning (GAF), and scales for aggressive behavior, impulsivity, adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and intelligent quotient (IQ).
   Aggressive compared to non-aggressive inmates exhibited lower Trp and Kyn serum levels but higher levels of 5-HT and 5-HT/Trp (*) 1000, higher levels of impulsivity and ADHD indices, lower IQ and GAF, higher prevalence of mood disorders, drug abuse/dependence, and borderline, conduct and antisocial behaviors. Interestingly, Kyn/Trp (*) 1000 was positively correlated to the number of severe aggressive acts (r = 0.593, P < 0.001). After adjusting for confounding factors, logistic regression analysis indicated that 5-HT/Trp (*) 1000, antisocial behavior, and GAF were predictors of aggressive behavior. The model combining these three predictors had an area under the ROC curve of 0.851 (95% CI 0.806-0.895).
   This study indicates that while circulating Trp is reduced in aggressive individuals, the combination of biological (5-HT/Trp ratio) and psychopathological (antisocial behavior and GAF) markers discriminates between aggressive and non-aggressive behavior suggesting the potential of a multi-marker approach in psychiatry given the heterogenic nature of mental diseases.

AB We investigated theoretically and empirically a range of training schedules on tasks with three knowledge types: declarative, procedural, and perceptual-motor. We predicted performance for 6435 potential eight-block training schedules with ACT-R's declarative memory equations. Hybrid training schedules (schedules consisting of distributed and massed practice) were predicted to produce better performance than purely distributed or massed training schedules. The results of an empirical study (N=40) testing four exemplar schedules indicated a more complex picture. There were no statistical differences among the groups in the declarative and procedural tasks. We also found that participants in the hybrid practice groups produced reliably better performance than ones in the distributed practice group for the perceptual-motor task - the results indicate training schedules with some spacing and some intensiveness may lead to better performance, particularly for perceptual-motor tasks, and that tasks with mixed types of knowledge might be better taught with a hybrid schedule. Practitioner Summary: We explored distributed and massed training schedules as well as hybrids between them with respect to three knowledge types based on theories and an empirical study. The results suggest that industrial and operator training in complex tasks need not and probably should not be done on a distributed training schedule.

AB In this article, we examine the advantages of simple metacognitive capabilities in a repeated social dilemma. Two types of metacognitive agent were developed and compared with a non-metacognitive agent and two fixed-strategy agents. The first type of metacognitive agent (opponent perspective) takes the perspective of the opponent to anticipate the opponent's future actions and respond accordingly. The other metacognitive agent (modeler) predicts the opponent's next move based on the previous moves of the agent and the opponent. The modeler agent achieves better individual outcomes than a non-metacognitive agent and is more successful at encouraging cooperation. The opponent-perspective agent, by contrast, fails to achieve these outcomes because it lacks important information about the opponent. These simple agents provide insights regarding modeling of metacognition in more complex tasks.

AB Memory plays a critical role in time estimation, yet detailed mechanisms underlying temporal memory have not been fully understood. The current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study investigated memory phenomena in absolute identification of time durations and line lengths. In both time and length identification, participants responded faster to end-of-range stimuli (e.g., the shortest or longest items of the stimulus set) than to middle stimuli. Participants performed worse in the incongruent condition (mismatch between time and length in the stimulus position) than in the congruent condition, indicating cross-dimensional interference between time and length. Both phenomena reflect increased difficulty of retrieving information relevant to the current context in the presence of context-irrelevant information. A region in the lateral inferior prefrontal cortex showed a greater response to the middle stimuli and in the incongruent condition suggesting greater demands for controlled memory retrieval. A cognitive model based on the ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought - Rational) declarative memory mechanisms accounted for the major behavioral and imaging results. The results suggest that contextual effects in temporal memory can be understood in terms of domain-general memory principles established outside the time estimation domain.

ID ARCHITECTURE
AB Process models of cognition, written in architectures such as ACT-R and EPIC, should be able to interact with the same software with which human subjects interact. By eliminating the need to simulate the experiment, this approach would simplify the modeler's effort, while ensuring that all steps required of the human are also required by the model. In practice, the difficulties of allowing one software system to interact with another present a significant barrier to any modeler who is not also skilled at this type of programming. The barrier increases if the programming language used by the modeling software differs from that used by the experimental software. The JSON Network Interface simplifies this problem for ACT-R modelers, and potentially, modelers using other systems.
