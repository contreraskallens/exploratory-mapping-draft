66		2004	webb mr lee md	modeling individual differences in category learning	proceedings of the twentyixth annual conference of the cognitive science society	many evaluations of cognitive models rely on data that have been averaged or aggregated across all experimental subjects and so fail to consider the possibility that there are important individual differences between subjects other evaluations are done at the singleubject level and so fail to benefit from the reduction of noise that data averaging or aggregation potentially provides to overcome these weaknesses we develop a general approach to modeling individual differences using families of cognitive models where different groups of subjects are identified as having different psychological behavior separate models with separate parameterizations are applied to each group of subjects and  model selection is used to determine the appropriate number of groups we demonstrate the general approach in a concrete and detailed way using the alcove model of category learning and data from four previously analysed category learning experiments meaningful individual differences are found for three of the four experiments and alcove is able to account for this variation through psychologically interpretable differences in parameterization the results highlight the potential of extending cognitive models to consider individual differences

72		2015	scheibehenne b von helversen b	selecting decision strategies the differential role of affect	cognition  emotion	many theories on cognition assume that people adapt their decision strategies depending on the situation they face to test if and how affect guides the selection of decision strategies we conducted an online study n  166 where different mood states were induced through video clips results indicate that mood influenced the use of decision strategies negative mood in particular anger facilitated the use of noncompensatory strategies whereas positive mood promoted compensatory decision rules these results are in line with the idea that positive mood broadens the focus of attention and thus increases the use of compensatory decision strategies that take many pieces of information into account whereas negative mood narrows the focus of attention and thus fosters noncompensatory strategies that rely on a selective use of information the results further indicate that gaining a deeper theoretical understanding of the cognitive mechanisms that govern decision processes requires taking emotions into account

174		2005	braber n patterson k ellis k ralph mal	the relationship between phonological and morphological deficits in broca aphasia further evidence from errors in verb inflection	brain and language	a previous study of 10 patients with broca aphasia demonstrated that the advantage for producing the past tense of irregular over regular verbs exhibited by these patients was eliminated when the two sets of pasttense forms were matched for phonological complexity bird lambon ralph seidenberg mcclelland  patterson 2003 the interpretation given was that a generalised phonological impairment was central to the patients language deficits including their poor performance on regular past tense verbs the current paper provides further evidence in favour of this hypothesis on the basis of a detailed analysis of the errors produced by these same 10 patients in reading repetition and sentence completion for a large number of regular irregular and nonce verbs the patients predominant error types in all tasks and for all verb types were close and distant phonologically related responses the balance between close and distant errors varied along three continua the severity of the patient more distant errors produced by the more severely impaired patients the difficulty of the task more distant errors in sentence completion  reading  repetition the difficulty of the item more distant errors for novel word forms than real verbs a position analysis for these phonologically related errors revealed that vowels were most likely to be preserved and that consonant onsets and offsets were equally likely to be incorrect critically the patients errors exhibited a strong tendency to simplify the phonological form of the target these results are consistent with the notion that the patients relatively greater difficulty with regular past tenses reflects a phonological impairment that is sensitive to the complexity of spoken forms 
175		2005	dennis s	a memorybased theory of verbal cognition	cognitive science	the syntagmatic paradigmatic model is a  memorybased account of verbal processing built on a  interpretation of string edit theory it characterizes the control of verbal cognition as the retrieval of sets of syntagmatic and paradigmatic constraints from sequential and relational longterm memory and the resolution of these constraints in working memory lexical information is extracted directly from text using a version of the expectation maximization algorithm in this article the model is described and then illustrated on a number of phenomena including sentence processing semantic categorization and rating shortterm serial recall and analogical and logical inference subsequently the model is used to answer questions about a corpus of tennis news articles taken from the internet the model success demonstrates that it is possible to extract propositional information from naturally occurring text without employing a grammar defining a set of heuristics or specifying a priori a set of semantic roles

407		2009	mirolli m parisi d	language as a cognitive tool	minds and machines	the standard view of classical cognitive science stated that cognition consists in the manipulation of languagelike structures according to formal rules since cognition is linguistic in itself according to this view language is just a complex communication system and does not influence cognitive processes in any substantial way this view has been criticized from several perspectives and a new framework  cognition has emerged that considers cognitive processes as nonymbolic and heavily dependent on the  interactions between the cognitive system and its environment but notwithstanding the successes of the  cognitive science in explaining lowlevel cognitive behaviors it is still not clear whether and how it can scale up for explaining highlevel cognition in this paper we argue that this can be done by considering the role of language as a cognitive tool ie how language transforms basic cognitive functions in the highlevel functions that are characteristic of human cognition in order to do that we review some  models that substantiate this view with respect to categorization and memory since these models are based on a very rudimentary form of nonyntactic language we argue that the use of language as a cognitive tool might have been an early discovery in hominid evolution and might have played a substantial role in the evolution of language itself

688		2012	adam h galinsky ad	enclothed cognition	journal of experimental social psychology	we introduce the term enclothed cognition to describe the systematic influence that clothes have on the wearer psychological processes we offer a potentially unifying framework to integrate past findings and capture the diverse impact that clothes can have on the wearer by proposing that enclothed cognition involves the cooccurrence of two independent factors the symbolic meaning of the clothes and the physical experience of wearing them as a first test of our enclothed cognition perspective the current research explored the effects of wearing a lab coat a pretest found that a lab coat is generally associated with attentiveness and carefulness we therefore predicted that wearing a lab coat would increase performance on attentionrelated tasks in experiment 1 physically wearing a lab coat increased selective attention compared to not wearing a lab coat in experiments 2 and 3 wearing a lab coat described as a doctor coat increased sustained attention compared to wearing a lab coat described as a painter coat and compared to simply seeing or even identifying with a lab coat described as a doctor coat thus the current research suggests a basic principle of enclothed cognitionit depends on both the symbolic meaning and the physical experience of wearing the clothes
