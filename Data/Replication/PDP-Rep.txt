AB Plaut and McClelland (2010) and Quian Quiroga and Kreiman (2010) both challenged my characterization of localist and distributed representations. They also challenged the biological plausibility of grandmother cells on conceptual and empirical grounds. This reply addresses these issues in turn. The premise of my argument is that grandmother cells in neuroscience are the equivalent of localist representations in psychology. When defined in this way, grandmother cells are biologically plausible, given the neuroscience to date. By contrast, the neurophysiology is shown to be inconsistent with the distributed representations often learned in existing parallel distributed processing (PDP) models, and it poses a challenge to PDP theories more generally.

TI Constructing a Niche for the Self: A Bio-Social, PDP Approach to
   Understanding Lives
SO SELF AND IDENTITY
LA English
DT Article
AB Viewing selves as negotiating idiosyncratic life niches may be useful in understanding life change. When less resistant self attributes and environmental presses conflict, the self tends to reflect the environment; when more resistant self attributes (e.g., those high in heritability) and environmental presses conflict, the individual will tend to change his or her personal environment in ways that better afford the expression of those self-attributes. Life niches result from attempts to satisfy simultaneous constraints from self-aspects such as abilities, desires, and temperament, and situational presses and affordances. Parallel distributed processing (PDP) networks appear to be a promising way to represent niche construction.

AB Joint attention is a fundamental cognitive ability that supports daily interpersonal relationships and communication. The Parallel Distributed Processing model (PDPM) postulates that responding to (RJA) and initiating (IJA) joint attention are predominantly supported by posterior-parietal and frontal regions respectively. It also argues that these neural networks integrate during development, supporting the parallel processes of self-and other-attention representation during interactions. However, direct evidence for the PDPM is limited due to a lack of ecologically valid experimental paradigms that can capture both RJA and IJA. Building on existing interactive approaches, we developed a virtual reality paradigm where participants engaged in an online interaction to complete a cooperative task. By including tightly controlled baseline conditions to remove activity associated with non-social task demands, we were able to directly contrast the neural correlates of RJA and IJA to determine whether these processes are supported by common brain regions. Both RJA and IJA activated broad frontotemporoparietal networks. Critically, a conjunction analysis identified that a subset of these regions were common to both RJA and IJA. This right-lateralised network included the dorsal portion of the middle frontal gyrus (MFG), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), middle temporal gyrus (MTG), precentral gyrus, posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and precuneus. Additional activation was observed in this network for IJA relative to RJA at MFG, IFG, TPJ and precuneus. This is the first imaging study to directly investigate the neural correlates common to RJA and IJA engagement, and thus support the assumption that a broad integrated network underlies the parallel aspects of both initiating and responding to joint attention.

AB This paper introduces a special issue of Cognitive Science initiated on the 25th anniversary of the publication of Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP), a two-volume work that introduced the use of neural network models as vehicles for understanding cognition. The collection surveys the core commitments of the PDP framework, the key issues the framework has addressed, and the debates the framework has spawned, and presents viewpoints on the current status of these issues. The articles focus on both historical roots and contemporary developments in learning, optimality theory, perception, memory, language, conceptual knowledge, cognitive control, and consciousness. Here we consider the approach more generally, reviewing the original motivations, the resulting framework, and the central tenets of the underlying theory. We then evaluate the impact of PDP both on the field at large and within specific subdomains of cognitive science and consider the current role of PDP models within the broader landscape of contemporary theoretical frameworks in cognitive science. Looking to the future, we consider the implications for cognitive science of the recent success of machine learning systems called "deep networks"-systems that build on key ideas presented in the PDP volumes.

The parallelized neural network software developed is based on the public domain NASA developed program NETS 2.01, which is based on the back propagation algorithm of Rumelhart et al. [Learning internal representation by error propagation. In Parallel Distributed Processing: Explorations in the Microstructure of Cognition (Edited by D. E. Rummelhart and J. L. McClelland), Vol. 1: Foundations. MIT Press, MA (1986)]. The principal focus of this research concerns the parallel implementation. Comparisons between sequential and parallel versions are given. Finally a structural design problem concerned with finite element mesh generation is solved using the parallel neural network software. (C) 1997 Civil-Comp Ltd and Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB For decades, category-specific semantic impairment - i.e., better comprehension of items from one semantic category than another - has been the driving force behind many claims about the organisation of conceptual knowledge in the brain. Double dissociations between patients with category-specific disorders are widely interpreted as showing that different conceptual domains are necessarily supported by functionally independent systems. We show that, to the contrary, even strong or classical dissociations can also arise from individual differences in premorbid expertise. We examined two patients with global and progressive semantic degradation who, unusually, had known areas of premorbid expertise. Patient 1, a former automotive worker, showed selective preservation of car knowledge, whereas Patient 2, a former botanist, showed selective preservation of information about plants. In non-expert domains, these patients showed the typical pattern: i.e., an inability to differentiate between highly similar concepts (e.g., rose and daisy), but retention of broader distinctions (e.g., between rose and cat). Parallel distributed processing (PDP) models of semantic cognition show that expertise in a particular domain increases the differentiation of specific-level concepts, such that the semantic distance between these items resembles non-expert basic-level distinctions. We propose that these structural changes interact with global semantic degradation, particularly when expert knowledge is acquired early and when exposure to expert concepts continues during disease progression. Therefore, category-specific semantic impairment can arise from at least two distinct mechanisms: damage to representations that are critical for a particular category (e.g., knowledge of hand shape and action for the category 'tools') and differences in premorbid experience.

AB This investigation explored the hypothesis that patterns of acquired dyslexia may reflect, in part, plasticity-driven relearning that dynamically alters the division of labour (DOL) between the direct, orthography -> phonology (O -> P) pathway and the semantically mediated, orthography -> semantics -> phonology (O -> S -> P) pathway. Three simulations were conducted using a variant of the triangle model of reading. The model demonstrated core characteristics of normal reading behaviour in its undamaged state. When damage was followed by reoptimization (mimicking spontaneous recovery), the model reproduced the deficits observed in the central dyslexias-acute phonological damage combined with recovery matched data taken from a series of 12 phonological dyslexic patients-whilst progressive semantic damage interspersed with recovery reproduced data taken from 100 observations of semantic dementia patients. The severely phonologically damaged model also produced symptoms of deep dyslexia (imageability effects, production of semantic and mixed semantic/visual errors). In all cases, the DOL changed significantly in the recovery period, suggesting that postmorbid functional reorganization is important in understanding behaviour in chronic-stage patients.

AB The ambiguity disadvantage (slower processing of ambiguous words relative to unambiguous words) has been taken as evidence for a distributed semantic representational system like that embodied in parallel distributed processing (PDP) models. In the present study, we investigated whether semantic ambiguity slows meaning activation, as PDP models would predict, by examining homophone effects in semantic categorisation tasks. We observed a homophone effect in a go/no-go semantic categorisation task, but not In a yes/no semantic categorisation task. Our results suggest that previously reported ambiguity effects may have been due to the decision phase of the semantic categorisation task and not to the semantic processing phase, in which case the interpretation of the ambiguity disadvantage will need to be reconsidered.

AB This paper proposes a frontend processing technique that employs a speech feature extraction method called Subband based Periodicity and Aperiodicity DEcomposition (SPADE), and examines its validity for automatic speech recognition in noisy environments. SPADE divides speech signals into subband signals, which are then decomposed into their periodic and aperiodic features, and uses both features as speech feature parameters. SPADE employs independent periodicity estimation within each subband and periodicity-aperiodicity decomposition design based on a parallel distributed processing technique motivated by the human speech perception process. Unlike other speech features, this decomposition of speech into two characteristics provides information about periodicities and aperiodicities, and thus allows the utilization of the robustness exhibited by periodic features without losing certain essential information included in aperiodic features. This paper first introduces an implementation of SPADE that operates in the frequency domain, and then examines the validity of combining SPADE with speech enhancement methods. For this examination, we combine SPADE with noise compensation methods that operate in the frequency domain and cepstral normalization methods. In addition, we employ an energy parameter calculation method based on the SPADE framework. An evaluation with the AURORA-2J noisy continuous digit speech recognition database (Japanese AURORA-2) shows that SPADE combined with adaptive Wiener filtering, cepstral normalization, and the energy parameter achieves average word accuracy rates of 82.58% with clean training and 92.55% with multicondition training. These rates are higher than those achieved with ETSI W1008 advanced DSR frontend processing (77.98% and 91.01%, respectively) whose speech feature parameter is based on conventional Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients. By comparison with ETSI W1008 advanced DSR frontend, the proposed method reduces word error rates by 20.9% with clean training and 17.2% with multicondition training. These results confirmed that SPADE combined with noise reduction methods can increase robustness in the presence of noise. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this article, I survey the integrated connectionist/symbolic (ICS) cognitive architecture in which higher cognition must be formally characterized on two levels of description. At the microlevel, parallel distributed processing (PDP) characterizes mental processing; this PDP system has special organization in virtue of which it can be characterized at the macrolevel as a kind of symbolic computational system. The symbolic system inherits certain properties from its PDP substrate; the symbolic functions computed constitute optimization of a well-formedness measure called Harmony. The most important outgrowth of the ICS research program is optimality theory (Prince & Smolensky, 1993/2004), an optimization-based grammatical theory that provides a formal theory of cross-linguistic typology. Linguistically, Harmony maximization corresponds to minimization of markedness or structural ill-formedness. Cognitive explanation in ICS requires the collaboration of symbolic and connectionist principles. ICS is developed in detail in Smolensky and Legendre (2006a); this article is a precis of and guide to those volumes.

AB Connectionist models of reading, in particular Seidenberg and McClelland's (1989) parallel distributed processing model of word recognition, are described and contrasted with the top-down, bottom-up, and interactive models of reading from the traditional, symbol-manipulation paradigm of information processing. Connectionism emphasizes: (1) a single, rather than dual, mechanism for processing words, and (2) distributed representations and weighted connections between units rather than symbolic rules for mapping letters and sounds. Implications for the teaching of reading are discussed.

AB Recent studies have suggested that reduced corticocortical connectivity is associated with schizophrenia. My colleagues and I have used neural network simulations to explore parallel, distributed processing systems with reduced connectivity. These systems often behaved in a ''schizophrenic-like'' manner. Excessively pruned attractor networks became functionally fragmented, suggesting ''loose associations,'' and produced recurrent, intrusive representations suggestive of delusions. Pruning backpropagation simulations of speech perception networks produced spontaneous output, which provided a model of auditory hallucination or ''voices.'' This model also suggested how dopamine-blocking drugs may reduce positive symptoms, and why negative symptoms arise in the wake of positive symptoms.

AB A connectionist model of the balance scale task is presented which exhibits developmental transitions between 'Rule I' and 'Rule II' behavior [Siegler, R. S. (1976). Three aspects of cognitive development. Cognitive Psychology, 8, 481-520.] as well as the 'catastrophe flags' seen in data from Jansen and van tier Maas [Jansen, B. R. J., & van tier Maas, H. L. J. (2001). Evidence for the phase transition from Rule I to Rule II on the balance scale task. Developmental Review, 21, 450-494]. The model extends a connectionist model of this task [McClelland, J. L. (1989). Parallel distributed processing: Implications for cognition and development. In R. G. M. Morris (Ed.), Parallel distributed processing: Implications for psychology and neurobiology (pp. 8-45). Oxford: Clarendon Press] by introducing intrinsic variability into processing and by allowing the network to adapt during testing in response to its own outputs. The simulations direct attention to several aspects of the experimental data indicating that children generally show gradual change in sensitivity to the distance dimension on the balance scale. While a few children show larger changes than are characteristic of the model, its ability to account for nearly all of the data using continuous processes is consistent with the view that the transition from Rule I to Rule II behavior is typically continuous rather than discrete in nature.

AB Classic identity negative priming (NP) refers to the finding that when an object is ignored, subsequent naming responses to it are slower than when it has not been previously ignored (Tipper, S.P., 1985. The negative priming effect: inhibitory priming by ignored objects. Q. J. Exp. Psychol. 37A, 571-590). It is unclear whether this phenomenon arises due to the involvement of abstract semantic representations that the ignored object accesses automatically. Contemporary connectionist models propose a key role for the anterior temporal cortex in the representation of abstract semantic knowledge (e.g., McClelland, J.L., Rogers, T.T., 2003. The parallel distributed processing approach to semantic cognition. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 4, 310-322), suggesting that this region should be involved during performance of the classic identity NP task if it involves semantic access. Using high-field (4 T) event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, we observed increased BOLD responses in the left anterolateral temporal cortex including the temporal pole that was directly related to the magnitude of each individual's NP effect, supporting a semantic locus. Additional signal increases were observed in the supplementary eye fields (SEF) and left inferior parietal lobule (IPL). (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Connectionist models based on activation spreading and attractor dynamics are functionally limited by representational and processing flexibility constraints, the 'feature binding problem' and the need to balance accurately activation and inhibition. We suggest an alternative approach, in which network units are characterized by two variables: activation and phase. Whereas activation evolves according to a 'classical' connectionist rule, the phase variable is characterized by a chaotic evolution. We present a model of memory retrieval with reference to the paradigmatic McClelland's 1981 'Jets and Sharks' model. The model solves the 'multiple reinstantiation problem', i.e. the problem of retrieval of multiple items with overlapping features, implied by its classical predecessor. In our network, multiple pattern reinstantiation in terms of activation spreading is disambiguate through selective and differential coherence patterns. The system flexibly represents pattern similarity and feature relationships by means of graded and intermittent synchrony. The domain-general implications of this approach for connectionist 'interactive activation models' and its neurophysiological plausibility are discussed.

AB Neural networks can be used as a tool in the explanation of neuropsychological data. Using the Hebbian Learning Rule and other such principles as competition and modifiable interlevel feedback, researchers have successfully modeled a widely used neuropsychological test, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. One of these models is reviewed here and extended to a qualitative analysis of how verbal fluency might be modeled, which demonstrates the importance of accounting for the attentional components of both tests. Difficulties remain in programming sequential cognitive processes within a parallel distributed processing (PDP) framework and integrating exceedingly complex neuropsychological tests such as Proverbs. PDP neural network methodology offers neuropsychologists co-validation procedures within narrowly defined areas of reliability and validity.

ID CONNECTIONISM
AB Neural networks offer an intriguing set of techniques for learning based on the adjustment of weights of connections between processing units.  However, the power and limitations of connectionist methods for learning, such as the method of back propagation in parallel distributed processing networks, are not yet entirely clear.  A set of experiments that more precisely identify the power and limitations of the method of back propagation is reported on.  The experiment on learning to compute the exclusive-or function suggests that the computational efficiency of learning by the method of back propagation depends on the initial weights in the network.  The experiment on learning to play tic-tac-toe suggests that the information content of what is learned by the back propagation method is dependent on the initial abstractions in the network.  It also suggests that these abstractions are a major source of power for learning in parallel distributed processing networks.  In addition, it is shown that the learning task addressed by connectionist methods, including the back propagation method, is computationally intractable.  These experimental and theoretical results strongly indicate that current connectionist methods may be too limited for the complex task of learning they seek to solve.  It is proposed that the power of neural networks may be enhanced by developing task-specific connectionist methods.

TI Being Someone: The Integrated Self as a Neuropsychological System
SO SOCIAL AND PERSONALITY PSYCHOLOGY COMPASS
LA English
DT Article
AB Fully functioning persons are characterized by a unity in thought, emotion, and action that amounts to "being someone" or having "an integrated self." Psychologists have typically treated the integrated self as merely a descriptive term that summarizes significant behavioral achievements. In the present article, the authors seek to place the integrated self on firmer theoretical grounds by relating the integrated self to a neurobiological system with distinct processing characteristics. Building on personality systems interactions theory (Kuhl, 2000b), the authors suggest that the integrated self is supported by parallel distributed processing in the right anterior cortex and can be distinguished from simpler self-related states of mind. From this neuropsychological model, the authors derive seven functions of the integrated self: emotional connectedness, broad vigilance, utilization of felt feedback, unconscious processing, integration of negative experiences, extended resilience, and extended trust. The authors discuss the seven functions and their mutual relations along with relevant behavioral and neurobiological evidence. Finally, the authors highlight the importance of positive relationships for optimal development of the integrated self and discuss how the integrated self might be further cultivated to improve self-regulation and health.

AB The majority of words in the English language do not correspond to a single meaning, but rather correspond to two or more unrelated meanings (i.e., are homonyms) or multiple related senses (i.e., are polysemes). It has been proposed that the different types of "semantically-ambiguous words" (i.e., words with more than one meaning) are processed and represented differently in the human mind. Several review papers and books have been written on the subject of semantic ambiguity (e.g., Adriaens, Small, Cottrell, & Tanenhaus, 1988; Burgess & Simpson, 1988; Degani & Tokowicz, 2010; Gorfein, 1989, 2001; Simpson, 1984). However, several more recent studies (e.g., Klein & Murphy, 2001; Klepousniotou, 2002; Klepousniotou & Baum, 2007; Rodd, Gaskell, & Marslen-Wilson, 2002) have investigated the role of the semantic similarity between the multiple meanings of ambiguous words on processing and representation, whereas this was not the emphasis of previous reviews of the literature. In this review, we focus on the current state of the semantic ambiguity literature that examines how different types of ambiguous words influence processing and representation. We analyze the consistent and inconsistent findings reported in the literature and how factors such as semantic similarity, meaning/sense frequency, task, timing, and modality affect ambiguous word processing. We discuss the findings with respect to recent parallel distributed processing (PDP) models of ambiguity processing (Armstrong & Plaut, 2008, 2011; Rodd, Gaskell, & Marslen-Wilson, 2004). Finally, we discuss how experience/instance-based models (e.g., Hintzman, 1986; Reichle & Perfetti, 2003) can inform a comprehensive understanding of semantic ambiguity resolution.

AB In addition to the high-speed parallel-distributed processing property, neural networks can be readily implemented by hardware and thus have been applied widely in various fields. In this paper, via a new numerical-differentiation formula, two Taylor-type discrete-time Zhang neural network (ZNN) models (termed T-ZNN-K and T-ZNN-U models) are first proposed, developed and investigated for online time-varying matrix pseudoinversion. For comparison as well as for illustration, Euler-type discrete-time ZNN models (termed E-ZNN-K and E-ZNN-U models) and Newton iteration are presented. In addition, according to the criterion of whether the time-derivative information of time-varying matrix is explicitly known or not, these discrete-time ZNN models are classified into two categories: (1) models with time-derivative information known (i.e., T-ZNN-K and E-ZNN-K models), and (2) models with time-derivative information unknown (i.e., T-ZNN-U and E-ZNN-U models). Moreover, theoretical analyses show that, the maximal steady-state residual errors (MSSREs) of T-ZNN-K and T-ZNN-U models have an O(tau(3)) pattern, the MSSREs of E-ZNN-K and E-ZNN-U models have an O(tau(2)) pattern, whereas the MSSRE of Newton iteration has an O(tau) pattern, with tau denoting the sampling gap. Finally, two illustrative numerical experiments and an application example to manipulator motion generation are provided and analyzed to substantiate the efficacy of the proposed Taylor-type discrete-time ZNN models for online time-varying matrix pseudoinversion.

AB A central claim shared by most recent models of short-term memory (STM) is that item knowledge is coded independently from order in long-term memory (LTM; e.g., the letter A is coded by the same representational unit whether it occurs at the start or end of a sequence). Serial order is computed by dynamically binding these item codes to a separate representation of order. By contrast, Botvinick and Plaut (2006) developed a parallel distributed processing (PDP) model of STM that codes for item-order information conjunctively, such that the same letter in different positions is coded differently in LTM. Their model supports a wide range of memory phenomena, and critically, STM is better for lists that include high, as opposed to low, sequential dependencies (e.g., bigram effects). Models with context-independent item representations do not currently account for sequential effects. However, we show that their PDP model is too sensitive to these effects. A modified version of the model does better but still fails in important respects. The successes and failures can be attributed to a fundamental constraint associated with context-dependent representations. We question the viability of conjunctive coding schemes to support STM and take these findings as problematic for the PDP approach to cognition more generally.

AB This study examines a parallel distributed processing (PDP) model (partly based on the Wernicke-Lichtheim information processing model) that posits two routes for naming concepts, whole word and phonological. To test the two naming route hypothesis of this model, we performed confrontation naming tests that were either uncued, semantically cued, or phonologically cued in a patient with naming impairment due to Brocas aphasia. In spoken language and in uncued naming to confrontation, word retrieval was severely impaired and marked by semantic but no phonemic paraphasic errors. With semantic cues, naming behavior was unchanged; however, with phonological cues, naming success was enhanced but frequent phonemic paraphasias were produced. These results suggest that the patient spontaneously engaged the whole word naming route, but when given phonological cues, he engaged an alternative phonological naming route that incorporated phonological sequence knowledge.

AB The purpose of this article is to show why consciousness and thought are not manifested in digital computers. Analyzing the rationale for claiming that the formal manipulation of physical symbols in Turing machines would emulate human thought, the article attempts to show why this proved false. This is because the reinterpretation of 'designation' and 'meaning' to accommodate physical symbol manipulation eliminated their crucial functions in human discourse. Words have denotations and intensional meanings because the brain transforms the physical stimuli received from the microworld into a qualitative, macroscopic representation for consciousness. Lacking this capacity as programmed machines, computers have no representations for their symbols to designate and mean. Unlike human beings in which consciousness and thought, with their inherent content, have emerged because of their organic natures, serial processing computers or parallel distributed processing systems, as programmed electrical machines, lack these causal capacities.

AB It is generally assumed that visual word recognition is accompanied by the activation of lexical representations corresponding to words orthographically similar to the target (neighbours). With regard to the pronunciation of their constituent units, these words can either converge with or diverge from the target pronunciation. The role of the frequency of the divergent pronunciations in print-to-sound conversion was examined in a naming experiment in which subjects pronounced regular and exception words. The results showed that naming latencies for exception words were affected by the orthographic similarity of the target with frequent phonologically divergent words (enemies). In a similar vein, regular words which include the letters G or C (whose pronunciations are contextually determined) and which are orthographically similar to words favouring an incorrect pronunciation of the letter took longer to pronounce than regular controls. A delayed naming experiment indicated that these differences were not attributable to the articulatory characteristics of the items. Finally, it also appeared that enemy frequency influenced naming latencies but not regularisation rates and regularisation latencies. The results are discussed within the framework of current dual-route and parallel distributed processing models of reading.

AB Large sample methods for estimating the variance of parameter estimates for hypothesis-testing purposes and statistical test for model selection when the statistical model is wrong (i.e., misspecified) are reviewed. A parallel distributed processing (PDP) statistical model for analyzing categorical time series data is then proposed, and a theorem establishing when the quasi-maximum likelihood estimates of the model are unique is stated and proved. Analysis of Golden et al.'s (1993, in the Proceedings of the 14th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society (pp. 487-491). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum) categorical time-series data with respect to the proposed PDP model showed that White's asymptotic statistical theory yielded results which were more consistent with boot-strap estimates than classical methods of statistical inference.

AB The Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) framework is built on neural-style computation, and is thus well-suited for simulating the neural implementation of cognition. However, relatively little cognitive modeling work has concerned neural measures, instead focusing on behavior. Here, we extend a PDP model of reading-related components in the Event-Related Potential (ERP) to simulation of the N400 repetition effect. We accomplish this by incorporating the dynamics of cortical post-synaptic potentials the source of the ERP signal into the model. Simulations demonstrate that application of these dynamics is critical for model elicitation of repetition effects in the time and frequency domains. We conclude that by advancing a neurocomputational understanding of repetition effects, we are able to posit an interpretation of their source that is both explicitly specified and mechanistically different from the well-accepted cognitive one.

AB Courtship songs produced by Drosophila males - wild-type, plus the cacophony and dissonance behavioral mutants - were examined with the aid of newly developed strategies for adaptive acoustic analysis and classification. This system used several techniques involving artificial neural networks (a.k.a. parallel distributed processing), including learned vector quantization of signals and non-linear adaption (back-propagation) of data analysis. "Pulse" song from several individual wild-type and mutant males were first vector-quantized according to their frequency spectra. The accumulated quantized data of this kind, for a given song, were then used to "teach" or adapt a multiple-layered feedforward artificial neural network, which classified that song according to its original genotype. Results are presented on the performance of the final adapted system when faced with novel test data and on acoustic features the system decides upon for predicting the song-mutant genotype in question. The potential applications and extensions of this new system are discussed, including how it could be used to screen for courtship mutants, search novel behavior patterns or cause-and-effect relationships associated with reproduction, compress these kinds of data for digital storage, and analyze Drosophila behavior beyond the case of courtship song.

AB A key insight from 50 years of neurophysiology is that some neurons in cortex respond to information in a highly selective manner. Why is this? We argue that selective representations support the coactivation of multiple "things" (e.g., words, objects, faces) in short-term memory, whereas nonselective codes are often unsuitable for this purpose. That is, the coactivation of nonselective codes often results in a blend pattern that is ambiguous; the so-called superposition catastrophe. We show that a recurrent parallel distributed processing network trained to code for multiple words at the same time over the same set of units learns localist letter and word codes, and the number of localist codes scales with the level of the superposition. Given that many cortical systems are required to coactivate multiple things in short-term memory, we suggest that the superposition constraint plays a role in explaining the existence of selective codes in cortex.

AB The emergentist-connectionist approach assumes that language processing reflects interaction between primary neural systems (Primary Systems Hypothesis). This idea offers an overarching framework that generalizes to various kinds of (English) language and nonverbal cognitive activities. The current study advances this approach with respect to language in two new and important ways. The first is the provision of a neuroanatomically constrained implementation of the theory. The second is a test of its ability to generalize to a language other than English (in this case Japanese) and, in particular, to a feature of that language (pitch accent) for which there is no English equivalent. A corpus analysis revealed the presence and distribution of typical and atypical accent forms in Japanese vocabulary, forming a quasiregular domain. Consequently, according to the Primary Systems Hypothesis, there should be a greater semantic impact on the processing of words with an atypical pitch accent. In turn, when word meaning is intrinsically less rich (e.g., abstract words), speakers should be prone to regularization errors of pitch accent. We explored these semantic-phonological interactions, first, in a neuroanatomically constrained, parallel-distributed processing model of spoken language processing. This model captured the accent typicality effect observed in nonword repetition in Japanese adults and children and exhibited the predicted semantic impact on repetition of words with atypical accent patterns. Second, also as predicted, in word repetition and immediate serial recall of spoken words, human participants exhibited reduced pitch-accent accuracy and/or slower RT for low imageability words with atypical accent patterns, and they generated accent errors reflecting the more typical accent patterns found in Japanese.

AB Connectionist models have had a profound impact on theories of language. While most early models were inspired by the classic parallel distributed processing architecture, recent models of language have explored various other types of models, including self-organizing models for language acquisition. In this paper, we aim at providing a review of the latter type of models, and highlight a number of simulation experiments that we have conducted based on these models. We show that self-organizing connectionist models can provide significant insights into long-standing debates in both monolingual and bilingual language development. We suggest future directions in which these models can be extended, to better connect with behavioral and neural data, and to make clear predictions in testing relevant psycholinguistic theories.

AB Rogers, Lambon Ralph, Hodges, and Patterson (2004) studied two-alternative forced-choice visual lexical decision performance in patients with semantic dementia. With item pairs where the target word was more "typical" (i.e., higher in bigram and trigram frequency) than the foil (all foils were pseudohomophones), lexical decision performance was good and was unaffected by word frequency. With item pairs where the target word was less "typical" (i.e., lower in bigram and trigram frequency) than the foil, lexical decision performance was worse and was affected by word frequency, being particularly inaccurate when the word targets were low in frequency. We show (using as materials all the monosyllabic items used by Rogers and colleagues) that the same pattern of results occurs in the lexical decision performance of the DRC (dual-route cascaded) computational model of reading when the model is lesioned by probabilistic deletion of low-frequency words from its orthographic lexicon. We consider that the PDP (parallel distributed processing) computational model of reading used by Woollams, Plaut, Lambon Ralph, and Patterson (2007) to simulate reading in semantic dementia is not capable of simulating this lexical decision result. We take this, in conjunction with previous work on computational modelling of reading aloud in surface dyslexia, phonological dyslexia, and semantic dementia using the DRC and PDP reading models, to indicate that the DRC model does a better job than the PDP model in accounting for what is known about the various forms of acquired dyslexia.

AB Extracellular action potentials of single neurons in motor cortex and rectified and integrated electromyographic activity (EMG) of gastrocnemius and anterior tibialis were recorded while a monkey performed isometric ankle plantar and dorsal flexion tasks.  This study determined the consistency of neuronal behaviors across different tasks.  Methods characterized neuronal behaviors by determining which behavioral event within a single task, such as the appearance of the 'go' signal, force onset, or agonist and antagonist EMG onset, was best related to changes in neuronal activity.  Another method compared the temporal profiles of discharge modulation across different tasks.  Of 220 neurons recorded, 44 were selected because they were consistently active in the tasks.  Of these, 37 were in the precentral cortex and the remaining seven were in the postcentral cortex.  Only 14 of the 33 in motor cortex were consistent in their behavioral correlations.  Several had multiple changes in activity within a single task that were related to different behavioral events.  Half were consistent for direction of force and a third were consistent for magnitude of force.  Furthermore, there was little consistency in the temporal profiles of discharge activity for all 44 neurons across tasks.  Similar modulations of discharge activity among neurons in one task were different in another task.  Such inconsistencies are evidence against the cardinal cell hypothesis of physiological representation.  We offer a new hypothesis analogous to connectionism in parallel distributed processing.

AB The exact role that phonological coding (the recoding of written, orthographic information into a sound based code) plays during silent reading has been extensively studied for more than a century. Despite the large body of research surrounding the topic, varying theories as to the time course and function of this recoding still exist. The present review synthesizes this body of research, addressing the topics of time course and function in tandem. The varying theories surrounding the function of phonological coding (e.g., that phonological codes aid lexical access, that phonological codes aid comprehension and bolster short-term memory, or that phonological codes are largely epiphenomenal in skilled readers) are first outlined, and the time courses that each maps onto (e.g., that phonological codes come online early [prelexical] or that phonological codes come online late [postlexical]) are discussed. Next the research relevant to each of these proposed functions is reviewed, discussing the varying methodologies that have been used to investigate phonological coding (e.g., response time methods, reading while eye-tracking or recording EEG and MEG, concurrent articulation) and highlighting the advantages and limitations of each with respect to the study of phonological coding. In response to the view that phonological coding is largely epiphenomenal in skilled readers, research on the use of phonological codes in prelingually, profoundly deaf readers is reviewed. Finally, implications for current models of word identification (activation-verification model, Van Orden, 1987; dual-route model, e.g., M. Coltheart, Rastle, Perry, Langdon, & Ziegler, 2001; parallel distributed processing model, Seidenberg & McClelland, 1989) are discussed.

AB Two experiments investigated naming performance for items with and without digraphs. Both experiments compared performance for Regular Consistent, Regular Inconsistent and Exception words. Experiment I also compared nonwords with Non-Existent Bodies to those with existing Consistent and Inconsistent Bodies. Naming was slower for nonwords containing digraphs and for nonwords constructed from Non-Existent bodies. In both experiments, the naming latency data for words showed effects of spelling-sound typicality only for words with digraphs; the speed of naming words without digraphs was not affected by either regularity or consistency. The complete set of results could not be effectively simulated by either the Dual-Route Cascaded model or by Plant, McClelland, Seidenberg, and Patterson's (1996) Parallel Distributed Processing models. The absence of effects of spelling-sound typicality for words without digraphs qualifies a phenomenon that has been regarded as one of the central facts of visual word recognition and provides strong constraints on the future development of computational models of lexical retrieval.

AB To understand the functional organization of the piriform cortex (PC), the axon collaterals of three pyramidal cells in layer IIb of the anterior PC and one pyramidal cell in layer IIb of the posterior PC were labeled and quantitatively analyzed by intracellular biocytin injection in the guinea pig. Single pyramidal cells in the anterior and posterior PCs have widely distributed axon collaterals, which exhibit little tendency for patchy concentrations inside as well as outside the PC. The total lengths of the axon collaterals of the three fully analyzed pyramidal cells ranged from 68 to 156 mm, more than 50% of which were distributed in the PC. The total number of boutons of the three cells ranged from 6000 to 14,000, 5000-7000 of which were distributed in the PC. It was estimated that individual pyramidal cells in layer IIb form synaptic contacts with 2200 to 3000 other pyramidal cells in the PC, indicating that single pyramidal cells in layer IIb receive input from a large number of other pyramidal cells. This high connectivity of the network of pyramidal cells in the PC can be regarded as the neural network operating parallel distributed processing, which may play an important role in experience-induced enhancement in odorant discrimination in the PC.

AB This paper presents a neural-network-based system that can generate and control movements of the eyes. It was inspired by a number of experimental observations on the saccadic and gaze systems of monkeys and cats. Because of the generality of the approach undertaken, the system can be regarded as a demonstration of how parallel distributed processing principles, namely learning and attractor dynamics, can be integrated with experimental findings, as well as a biologically inspired controller for a dexterous robotic orientation device. The system is composed of three parts: a dynamic motor map, a push-pull circuitry, and a plant. The dynamics of the motor map is generated by a multi-layer network that was trained to compute a bidimensional temporal-spatial transformation. Simulation results indicate (1) that the system is able to reproduce some of the properties observed in the biological system at the neural and movement levels and (2) that the dynamics of the motor map remains stereotyped even when the motor map is subject to abnormal stimulation patterns. The latter result emphasizes the role of the topographic projection that connects the motor map to the push-pull circuitry in determining the features of the resulting movements.

AB Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show atypical patterns of learning and generalization. We explored the possible impacts of autism-related neural abnormalities on perceptual category learning using a neural network model of visual cortical processing. When applied to experiments in which children or adults were trained to classify complex two-dimensional images, the model can account for atypical patterns of perceptual generalization. This is only possible, however, when individual differences in learning are taken into account. In particular, analyses performed with a self-organizing map suggested that individuals with high-functioning ASD show two distinct generalization patterns: one that is comparable to typical patterns, and a second in which there is almost no generalization. The model leads to novel predictions about how individuals will generalize when trained with simplified input sets and can explain why some researchers have failed to detect learning or generalization deficits in prior studies of category learning by individuals with autism. On the basis of these simulations, we propose that deficits in basic neural plasticity mechanisms may be sufficient to account for the atypical patterns of perceptual category learning and generalization associated with autism, but they do not account for why only a subset of individuals with autism would show such deficits. If variations in performance across subgroups reflect heterogeneous neural abnormalities, then future behavioral and neuroimaging studies of individuals with ASD will need to account for such disparities.

AB J.S. Bowers, M. F. Damian, and C.J. Davis (2009) critiqued the computational model of serial order memory put forth in M. Botvinick and D. C. Plaut (2006), purporting to show that the model does not generalize in a way that people do. They attributed this supposed failure to the model's dependence on context-dependent representations, translating this argument into a general critique of all parallel distributed processing models. The authors reply here, addressing both Bowers et al.'s criticisms of the Botvinick and Plaut model and the former's assessment of parallel distributed processing models in general.

AB This paper represents that auto tuning of 2-DOF PID Controller can be effectively performed by immune algorithms. A number of tuning approaches for PID controllers are considered in the context of intelligent tuning methods. However, in the case of 2-DOF PID Controller, quite a few tuning based on the classical approach such a trial and error has been suggested. Also, a general view is provided that they are the special cases of either the linear model or the single control system. On the other hand, since the immune network system possesses a self organizing and distributed memory, it is thus adaptive to its external environment and allows a PDP (parallel distributed processing) network to complete patterns against the environmental situation. Also. It can provide optimal solution. Simulation results reveal that immune algorithms based tuning are an effective approaches to search for optimal or near optimal control.

The present article (a) takes issue with the characterization given by Cohen et al. of the authors' approach as a classical speed-of-processing account of Stroop effects, (b) discusses the value and relevance of other theoretical concepts, such as traditional accounts of working memory and parallel distributed processing (PDP) approaches to Stroop effects, (c) further examines the possibility that the differences the authors observed in Experiment 2 between normal participants' performance and that of participants with schizophrenia may have been due to distracter stimulus degradation, particularly for participants with schizophrenia, and (d) argues for the relevance of the prefrontal cortex, as well as other brain areas, in accounting for their results. The authors conclude with a final theoretical question.

AB Optic aphasic patients are selectively impaired at naming visually presented objects but demonstrate relative intact comprehension of those objects (e.g., by gesturing or categorization) and are able to name them when presented in other modalities (e.g., via tactile input). This and other modality-specific naming deficits have been taken as evidence that semantics is organized into distinct modality-specific subsystems. We adopt an alternative view in which semantics is a set of learned, internal representations within a parallel distributed processing system that maps between multiple input and output modalities. We account for the critical aspects of optic aphasia in terms of the effects of damage to such a system, despite its lack of modality-specific specialization. We show that the robustness of a task in such a system depends critically on its systematicity, and that modality-specific naming deficits can arise because naming is an unsystematic task.

AB Artificial neural       networks (ANNs) are information processing systems motivated by the goals of reproducing the cognitive processes and organizational models of neurobiological systems. By virtue of their computational structure,    ANN's      feature      attractive characteristics such as graceful degradation, robust recall with noisy and fragmented data, parallel distributed processing. generalization to patterns outside of the training set, nonlinear modeling capabilities, and learning. These computational features could provide enhanced inferencing functionality and real-time capabilities to develop approaches for traditional difficult problems such as flexible manufacturing system (FMS) scheduling. In this paper three different schemes of ANN's are applied to the FMS scheduling problem. These include a) relaxation-based networks, b) competitive-based schemes, and c) adaptive pattern recognition scheduling.

AB Models of reading must explain how orthographic input activates a phonological representation, and elicits the retrieval of word meaning from semantic memory. Comparisons between tasks that theoretically differ with respect to the degree to which they rely on connections between orthographic, phonological and semantic systems during reading can thus provide valuable insight into models of reading, but such direct comparisons are not well-represented in the literature. An ALE meta-analysis explored lexicality effects directly contrasting words and pseudowords using the lexical decision task and overt or covert naming, which we assume rely most on the semantic and phonological systems, respectively. Interactions between task and lexicality effects demonstrate that different demands of the lexical decision and naming tasks lead to different manifestations of lexicality effects.

AB Neural circuitry is a self-organizing arithmetic device that converts input to output and thereby remodels its computational algorithm to produce more desired output; however, experimental evidence regarding the mechanism by which information is modified and stored while propagating across polysynaptic networks is sparse. We used functional multineuron calcium imaging to monitor the spike outputs from thousands of CA1 neurons in response to the stimulation of two independent sites of the dentate gyrus in rat hippocampal networks ex vivo. Only pyramidal cells were analyzed based on post hoc immunostaining. Some CA1 pyramidal cells were observed to fire action potentials only when both sites were simultaneously stimulated (AND-like neurons), whereas other neurons fired in response to either site of stimulation but not to concurrent stimulation (XOR-like neurons). Both types of neurons were interlaced in the same network and altered their logical operation depending on the timing of paired stimulation. Repetitive paired stimulation for brief periods induced a persistent reorganization of AND and XOR operators, suggesting a flexibility in parallel distributed processing. We simulated these network functions in silico and found that synaptic modification of the CA3 recurrent excitation is pivotal to the shaping of logic plasticity. This work provides new insights into how microscopic synaptic properties are associated with the mesoscopic dynamics of complex microcircuits.

DE decision making; Stroop; Pieron's law; additive factors method
AB Previously, it has been shown experimentally that the psychophysical law known as Pieron's Law holds for color intensity and that the size of the effect is additive with that of Stroop condition (Stafford et al., 2011). According to the additive factors method (Donders, 1868 1869/1969; Sternberg, 1998), additivity is assumed to indicate independent and discrete processing stages. We present computational modeling work, using an existing Parallel Distributed Processing model of the Stroop task (Cohen et al., 1990) and a standard model of decision making (Ratcliff, 1978). This demonstrates that additive factors can be successfully accounted for by existing single stage models of the Stroop effect. Consequently, it is not valid to infer either discrete stages or separate loci of effects from additive factors. Further, our modeling work suggests that information binding may be a more important architectural property for producing additive factors than discrete stages.

AB We share with Anderson & Lebiere (A&L) (and with Newell before them) the goal of developing a domain-general framework for modeling cognition, and we take seriously the issue of evaluation criteria. We advocate a more focused approach than the one reflected in Newell's criteria, based on analysis of failures as well as successes of models brought into close contact with experimental data. A&L attribute the shortcomings of our parallel-distributed processing framework to a failure to acknowledge a symbolic level of thought. Our framework does acknowledge a symbolic level, contrary to their claim. What we deny is that the symbolic eve is the level at which the principles of cognitive processing should be formulated. Models cast at a symbolic level are sometimes useful as high-level approximations of the underlying mechanisms of thought. The adequacy of this approximation will continue to increase as symbolic modelers continue to incorporate principles of parallel distributed processing.

Institute for Cognitive Science, University bf California, San Diego.] which allows: the processing of data with a temporal component, neural networks have been used routinely for sequence processing. This type of network is analysed in this paper for its ability to discriminate between different languages based on its processing of a small sample of text. The motivation for developing this model was for its potential use in the on-line version of a Trinity College 1872 Printed Catalogue, a library catalogue which has entries in 14 different languages spanning over 5 centuries. It was thought that neural networks would perform well where entries to be analysed comprised only a few words. The neural network's performance was compared with that of trigrams and a suffix/morphology analysis. The trigrams proved to be superior, classifying-over 92% of the entries correctly compared to 88% for the neural network and 85% for the morphology/suffix analysis. Trigrams were also far superior in the speed at which statistics were compiled and the rate at which text was processed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A systematic approach has been developed to construct neural networks for qualitative analysis and reasoning. These neural networks are used as specialized parallel distributed processors for solving constraint satisfaction problems. A typical application of such a neural network is to determine a reasonable change of a system after one or more of its variables are changed. A six-node neural network is developed to represent fundamental qualitative relations. A larger neural network can be constructed hierarchically for a system to be modeled by using six-node neural networks as building blocks. The complexity of the neural network building process is thus kept manageable. An example of developing a neural network reasoning model for a transistor equivalent circuit is demonstrated. The use of this neural network model in the equivalent circuit parameter extraction process is also described.

TI CONNECTIONISM AND THE FATE OF FOLK PSYCHOLOGY - A REPLY TO RAMSEY, STICH

SO PHILOSOPHICAL PSYCHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Ramsey, Stich and Garon (1991) argue that if the correct theory of mind is some parallel distributed processing theory, then folk psychology must be false.  Their idea is that if the nodes and connections that encode one representation are causally active then all representations encoded by the same set of nodes and connections are also causally active.  We present a clear, and concrete, counterexample to RSG's argument.
   In conclusion, we suggest that folk psychology and connectionism are best understood as complementary theories.  Each has different limitations, yet each will co-evolve with the other in an overlapping domain of 'normal' psychology.

AB This paper critically examines the claim that parallel distributed processing (PDP) networks are autonomous learning systems. A PDP model of a simple distributed associative memory is considered. It is shown that the 'generic' PDP architecture cannot implement the computations required by this memory system without the aid of external control. In other words, the model is not autonomous. Two specific problems are highlighted (i) simultaneous learning and recall are not permitted to occur as would be required of an autonomous system; (ii) connections between processing units cannot simultaneously represent current and previous network activation as would be required if learning is to occur. Similar problems exist for more sophisticated networks constructed from the generic PDP architecture. We argue that this is because these models are not adequately constrained by the properties of the functional architecture assumed by PDP modelers. It is also argued that without such constraints, PDP researchers cannot claim to have developed an architecture radically different from that proposed by the Classical approach in cognitive science.

AB The key claim associated with a grandmother cell theory is that single neurons selectively represent one complex 'thing' (e.g. object and face). However, this theory is often mischaracterised in the cognitive and neuroscience literatures. I summarise two common confusions here. First, critics of grandmother cells often fail to distinguish between the selectivity and sparseness of neural firing and, as a result, predict (incorrectly) that one and only one neuron should fire in response to a given input. Second, critics often fail to distinguish between what a neuron responds to and what it represents - as detailed below - and as a result, predict (incorrectly) that a grandmother cell should fire in response to one and only one thing. I argue that these two confusions often lead to the premature rejection of grandmother cell theories.

ID ADAPTIVE UNSTRUCTURED MESHES
AB The Information Power Grid (IPG) concept developed by NASA is aimed to provide a metacomputing platform for large-scale distributed computations, by hiding the intricacies of a highly heterogeneous environment and yet maintaining adequate security. In this paper, we propose a latency-tolerant partitioning scheme that dynamically balances processor workloads on the IPG, and minimizes data movement and runtime communication. By simulating an unsteady adaptive mesh application on a wide area network, we study the performance of our load balancer under the Globus environment. The number of IPG nodes, the number of processors per node, and the interconnect speeds are parameterized to derive conditions under which the IPG would be suitable for parallel distributed processing of such applications. Experimental results demonstrate that effective solutions are achieved when the IPG nodes are connected by a high-speed asynchronous interconnection network.

AB This paper outlines a theoretical model of attention and cognition using artificial neural network properties, the Sweeping Model. This model includes a sensory memory, a self modifying neural network (capable of forming associations, and of pattern completion), a system applying synchronous sweeps of lateral inhibition across the neural network, and a subsystem to evaluate the body state of the system to control this sweep frequency. After further description, it will be argued that these components can result in behaviours such as learning and performing according to primary and secondary reinforcement rules.

AB The phonomotor treatment program for treating word-retrieval deficits among people with aphasia is inspired by a parallel distributed processing model of lexical processing and is focused at the level of individual phonemes and phoneme sequences. Because verbal production of words involves the translation of a lexical-semantic representation into phonological representations, training the repertoire of phonological sequences should enable individuals with anomia to regain the ability to learn words and sequences, generalize to linguistic items not trained, and continue growth following treatment termination. The development and refinement of the phonomotor treatment program, which began in 2000, have followed the 5-phase model for communication disorders and sciences framework outlined by R. Robey (2004). To date, there have been 8 published articles on the phonomotor treatment program. A large-scale randomized trial comparing phonomotor with standard of care for word-retrieval deficits is underway. The goal of this article is to review the theoretical framework, treatment procedures, current evidence, and future directions of the phonomotor protocol.

AB Why do some neurons in hippocampus and cortex respond to information in a highly selective manner? It has been hypothesized that neurons in hippocampus encode information in a highly selective manner in order to support fast learning without catastrophic interference, and that neurons in cortex encode information in a highly selective manner in order to co-activate multiple items in short-term memory (STM) without suffering a superposition catastrophe. However, the latter hypothesis is at odds with the widespread view that neural coding in the cortex is highly distributed in order to support generalization. We report a series of simulations that characterize the conditions in which recurrent Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) models of immediate serial can recall novel words. We found that these models learned localist codes when they succeeded in generalizing to novel words. That is, just as fast learning may explain selective coding in hippocampus, STM and generalization may help explain the existence of selective codes in cortex. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB The field of formal linguistics was founded on the premise that language is mentally represented as a deterministic symbolic grammar. While this approach has captured many important characteristics of the world's languages, it has also led to a tendency to focus theoretical questions on the correct formalization of grammatical rules while also de-emphasizing the role of learning and statistics in language development and processing. In this review we present a different approach to language research that has emerged from the parallel distributed processing or 'connectionist' enterprise. In the connectionist framework, mental operations are studied by simulating learning and processing within networks of artificial neurons. With that in mind, we discuss recent progress in connectionist models of auditory word recognition, reading, morphology, and syntactic processing. We argue that connectionist models can capture many important characteristics of how language is learned, represented, and processed, as well as providing new insights about the source of these behavioral patterns. Just as importantly, the networks naturally capture irregular (non-rule-like) patterns that are common within languages, something that has been difficult to reconcile with rule-based accounts of language without positing separate mechanisms for rules and exceptions.

AB This paper proposes a new methodology, Sliding Window-based Support Vector Regression (SW-SVR), for micrometeorological data prediction. SVR is derived from a statistical learning theory and can be used to predict a quantity forward in time based on training that uses past data. Although SVR is superior to traditional learning algorithms such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), it is difficult to choose the suitable amount of training data to build an optimum SVR model for micrometeorological data prediction. This paper revealed the periodic characteristics of micrometeorological data and evaluated SW-SVR can adapt the appropriate amount of training data to build an optimum SVR model automatically using parallel distributed processing. The future prediction experiment was conducted on air temperature of Sapporo, Tokyo, Hamamatsu, and Naha. As a result, SW-SVR has improved prediction accuracy in Sapporo, and Tokyo. In addition, it has reduced calculation time by more than 96 % in all regions. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB A significant problem in computational language learning is that of inferring the content of well-formedness constraints from input data. In this article, we approach the constraint induction problem as the gradual adjustment of subsymbolic constraints in a connectionist network. In particular, we develop a multi-layer feed-forward network that learns the constraints that underlie restrictions against homorganic consonants, or 'OCP-Place constraints', in Arabic roots. The network is trained using standard learning procedures in connection science with a representative sample of Arabic roots. The trained network is shown to classify actual and novel Arabic roots in ways that are qualitatively parallel to a psycholinguistic study of Arabic. Statistical analysis of network behavior also shows that activations of nodes in the hidden layer correspond well with violations of symbolic well-formedness constraints familiar from generative phonology. In sum, it is shown that at least some constraints operative in phonotactic grammar can be learned from data and do not have to be stipulated in advance of learning. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB T. T. Rogers and K. Patterson (2007), in their article "Object Categorization: Reversals and Explanations of the Basic-Level Advantage" (Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 136, 451469), reported an impressive set of results demonstrating a reversal of the highly robust basic-level advantage both in patients with semantic dementia and in healthy individuals engaged in a speeded categorization task. To explain their results, as well as the usual basic-level advantage seen in healthy individuals, the authors employed a parallel distributed processing theory of conceptual knowledge. In this paper, we introduce an alternative way of explaining the results of Rogers and Patterson, which is premised on a more restricted set of assumptions born from standard categorization theory. Specifically, we provide evidence that their results can be accounted for based on the predictions of the simplicity model of unsupervised categorization.

AB The commentaries reflect three core themes that pertain not just to our theory, but to the enterprise of connectionist modeling more generally. The first concerns the relationship between a cognitive theory and an implemented computer model. Specifically, how does one determine, when a model departs from the theory it exemplifies, whether the depature is a useful simplification or a critical flaw? We argue that the answer to this question depends partially upon the model's intended function, and we suggest that connectionist models have important functions beyond the commonly accepted goals of fitting data and making predictions. The second theme concerns perceived in-principle limitations of the connectionist approach to cognition, and the specific concerns these perceived limitations raise for our theory. We argue that the approach is not in fact limited in the ways our critics suggest. One common misconception, that connectionist models cannot address abstract or relational structure, is corrected through new simulations showing directly that such structure and be captured. The third theme concerns the relationship between parallel distributed processing (PDP) models and structured probabilistic approaches. In this case we argue that there the difference between the approaches is not merely one of levels. Our PDP approach differs from structured statistical approaches at all of Marr's levels, including the characterization of the goals of cognitive computations, and of the respresentations and algorithms used.

AB It is claimed that there are pre-objective phenomena, which cognitive science should explain by employing the notion of non-conceptual representational content. It is argued that a match between parallel distributed processing (PDP) and non-conceptual content (NCC) not only provides a means of refuting recent criticisms of PDP as a cognitive architecture; it also provides a vehicle for NCC that is required by naturalism. A connectionist cognitive mapping algorithm is used as a case study to examine the affinities between PDP and NCC.

AB Four major machine learning paradigms have potential applications in forest research:  the inductive paradigm, the analytic paradigm, the genetic algorithms paradigm, and the parallel distributed processing, also known as the artificial neural network paradigm. In addition to helping forest researchers acquire knowledge and formulate production rules for expert systems, machine learning provides alternative methods for solving diverse problems, such as integrating forestry literature, data analysis, and modeling (both quantitative and qualitative). Machine learning methods appropriate for accomplishing the tasks are identified.

On the contrary, I claim that our explanations do not actually explain because they lack mechanism information and that is why the public has a negative view of psychology. Some of the mechanism information required to move from interpretations to explanations can be found in parallel distributed processing connectionist neural network models of psychology and behavior.

AB Functional neuroimaging and Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) theory, both introduced to cognitive science in the 1980s, led to influential research programmes that have proceeded in parallel with little mutual influence. The PDP approach advanced specific claims about the nature of neural representations that, perhaps surprisingly, have gone largely untested in functional brain imaging. One reason may be the widespread use of univariate statistical methods for analysing brain imaging data, which typically rely on assumptions that render them unable to detect distributed representations of the kind that PDP predicts. More recent multivariate methods for image analysis may be better suited to detecting such representations. In the current article, we consider why univariate methods have been insufficient to test PDP's representational claims, articulate some of the properties that neural representations ought to have if the PDP view is valid and then survey the recent neuroimaging literature for evidence that neural representations do or do not have these properties. The survey establishes that the PDP view of distributed representations has considerable evidential support. This analysis underscores the importance of understanding how the assumptions underlying methods for analysing functional imaging data constrain the kinds of questions that can be addressed. We then consider the implications for our developing understanding of the neural bases of cognition and for the design of future brain imaging studies.

AB Connectionist models have been applied to many phenomena in infant development including perseveration, language learning, categorization, and causal perception. In this article, we discuss the benefits of connectionist networks for the advancement of theories of early development. In particular, connectionist models contribute novel testable predictions, instantiate the theorized mechanism of change, and create a unifying framework for understanding infant learning and development. We relate these benefits to the 2 primary approaches used in connectionist models of infant development. The first approach employs changes in neural processing as the basis for developmental changes, and the second employs changes in infants' experiences. The review sheds light on the unique hurdles faced by each approach as well as the challenges and solutions related to both, particularly with respect to the identification of critical model components, parameter specification, availability of empirical data, and model comparison. Finally, we discuss the future of modeling work as it relates to the study of development. We propose that connectionist networks stand to make a powerful contribution to the generation and revision of theories of early child development. Furthermore, insights from connectionist models of early development can improve the understanding of developmental changes throughout the life span.

AB Phylogenetic tree construction has received much attention recently due to the availability of vast biological data. In this study, we provide a three step method to build phylogenetic trees. Firstly, a density-based clustering algorithm is used to provide clusters of the population at hand using the distance matrix which shows the distances of the species. Secondly, a phylogenetic tree for each cluster is constructed by using the neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm and finally, the roots of the small phylogenetic trees are connected again by the NJ algorithm to form one large phylogenetic tree. To our knowledge, this is the first method for building phylogenetic trees that uses clustering prior to forming the tree. As such, it provides independent phylogenetic tree formation within each cluster as the second step, hence is suitable for parallel/distributed processing, enabling fast processing of very large biological data sets.
   The proposed method, clustered neighbor-joining (CNJ) is applied to 145 samples from the Y-DNA Haplogroup G. Distances between male samples are the variation in their set of Y-chromosomal short tandem repeat (STR) values. We show that the clustering method we use is superior to other clustering methods as applied to Y-DNA data and also independent, fast distributed construction of phylogenetic trees is possible with this method.

Experimental results show that the scheme is able to detect noisy patterns with comparable accuracy to the conventional techniques.

AB Connectionist models are usually based on artificial neural networks. However, there is another route towards parallel distributed processing. This is by considering the origins of the intelligence displayed by the single celled organisms known as protoctists. Such intelligence arises by means of the biochemical interactions within the animal. An artificial model of this might therefore be termed an artificial biochemical network or ABN. This paper describes the attributes of such networks and illustrates their abilities in pattern recognition problems and in generating time-varying signals of a type which can be used in many control tasks. The flexibility of the system is explained using legged robots as an example. The networks are trained using back propagation and evolutionary algorithms such as genetic algorithms.

On the other hand, since the immune network system possesses a self organizing and distributed memory, it is thus adaptive to its external environment and allows a PDP (parallel distributed processing) network to complete patterns against the environmental situation. Also. It can provide optimal solution. Simulation results by immune based weight tuning reveal that immune algorithm is an effective approach to search for optimal or near optimal process control.

AB In this work we present the parallelisation of the global strategy with first least-connected node (GS-FLCN), which is a novel structural technique for the classification of unmeasured variables in process plant instrumentation design. The algorithm aims at partitioning the process' occurrence matrix to a specific block lower-triangular form. A parallel master-workers philosophy is employed to search for all the paths of a given length existing in the associated graph. The code was conceived for distributed environments and the implementation was carried out using the parallel virtual machine (PVM) library. The performance of the parallel algorithm was tested for industrial case studies and the results were compared with those yielded by the sequential version. The time savings achieved thanks to the parallelisation. were significant. Besides, in the parallel version, more paths can be explored per unit time. In practice, this implies greater robustness.

AB Munakata's model of the A-not-B task provides an excellent fit to behavioral data from human infants. From a neuropsychological standpoint, however, its architecture is not very plausible. Dehaene and Changeux's (1989) neuronal model of delayed response tasks, while admittedly very simple, relies on identified features of brain architecture such as multiple hierarchical pathways, bistable clusters with sustained activity, and diffuse reward systems. Ways in which the insights provided by both models might be combined are discussed.

AB Recent advancements in computational modelling have opened new ways to understand the underlying mechanisms of cognitive deficits resulting from brain damage. These implementations have followed interactive activation and parallel distributed processing approaches and the computational potential of more transparent and serial cognitive architectures has not received much attention. We tested the ability of the discrete two-stage word production model to account for naming response patterns in aphasia. Our implementation is a simple local connectionist model with two serially ordered networks representing lexical-semantic and phoneme levels. Anemic deficits were simulated by manipulating three parameters: noise within the two networks leading to semantically and phonologically based errors, and between-level threshold leading to no responses. Comparisons to actual naming data from 10 aphasics showed that this simple model provides a rather good fit to a variety of clinically observed naming response patterns. However, the existence of output-type semantic naming errors in some aphasics call for a modified discrete two-stage model which would pos sess monitoring mechanisms for lexical output.

AB Previous clinical studies have demonstrated that executive functioning has a significant association with the frontal lobes. In this study we examined executive functioning with parallel distributed processing (PDP) methodology by attempting to replicate Tower of Hanoi (TOH) neuropsychological test performance differences in normal healthy controls vs. left frontal lobe patients. Initial theoretical experiments were carried out to solve computer subprocessing constraints of the TOH partially by determining the programming prerequisites for a specific number of rings, efficient sequencing, and a general learning rule. These preliminary studies were then modified using a back-propagation neurocomputational approach. Computer program output showed a resemblance to normal controls' TOH moves. Degrading of the left frontal lobe patients' network resulted in characteristic impairments of executive functioning, i.e., perseveration and rule-braking.

AB Over recent years, the focus of artificial intelligence (AI) research has shifted from top-down simulation of high-level cognitive functions based on (essentially-ungrounded) symbolic computations to consideration of the way that intelligent behaviour can emerge in bottom-up fashion in systems situated in the 'real' world. Inspirations from neurobiology and concepts of neural information processing have been very influential in this 'new' AI: most usually in the guise of 'parallel distributed processing' approaches operating at a high level of abstraction, or the more detailed and biologically-realistic 'computational neuroscience' paradigm.
   In this paper, we describe a biologically-motivated approach to learning in situated robots based on the computational neuroscience paradigm. The mechanisms by which such learning occurs are habituation, sensitisation and classical conditioning of the neural responses involved in basic, pre-existing ('hard-wired') reflexes. Emergent light-seeking and collision-avoidance behaviors are observed in an adaptive mobile robot embodying these learning principles, as a result of interaction with its environment.

AB A parallel distributed processing approach to the computation of localized fractal dimension values in imagery is presented. This approach is a further development of the covering method which requires only nearest neighbor communication. A major benefit of our approach is the ability to readily incorporate any boundary information that may be available. Many fractal textures or surfaces are fractal only in distribution. With this in mind, we show that comparison of the fractal dimension distributions via Kullback-Leibler can give an improved texture discrimination capability over comparison of computed fractal dimension. Results are presented for a set of textures.

AB Orthographic neighborhood (N) size effects have been extensively studied in English consistently producing a facilitatory effect in word naming tasks. In contrast, several recent studies on Chinese character naming have demonstrated an inhibitory effect of neighborhood size. Response latencies tend to be inhibited by inconsistent characters with large neighborhoods relative to small neighborhoods. These differences in neighborhood effects between languages may depend on the characteristics (depth) of the mapping between orthography and phonology. To explore this, we first conducted a behavioral experiment to investigate the relationship between neighborhood size, consistency and reading response. The results showed an inhibitory effect of neighborhood size for inconsistent characters but a facilitatory effect for consistent characters. We then developed two computational models, based on parallel distributed processing principles to try and capture the nature of the processing that leads to these results in Chinese character naming. Simulations using models based on the triangle model of reading indicated that consistency and neighborhood size interact with the division of labor between semantics and phonology to produce these effects.

AB Although categorization can take place at different levels of abstraction, classic studies on semantic labeling identified the basic level, for example, dog, as entry point for categorization. Ultrarapid categorization tasks have contradicted these findings, indicating that participants are faster at detecting superordinate-level information, for example, animal, in a complex visual image. We argue that both seemingly contradictive findings can be reconciled within the framework of parallel distributed processing and its successor Leabra (Local, Error-driven and Associative, Biologically Realistic Algorithm). The current study aimed at verifying this prediction in an ultrarapid categorization task with a dynamically changing presentation time (PT) for each briefly presented object, followed by a perceptual mask. Furthermore, we manipulated two defining task variables: level of categorization (basic vs. superordinate categorization) and object presentation mode (object-in-isolation vs. object-in-context). In contradiction with previous ultrarapid categorization research, focusing on reaction time, we used accuracy as our main dependent variable. Results indicated a consistent superordinate processing advantage, coinciding with an overall improvement in performance with longer PT and a significantly more accurate detection of objects in isolation, compared with objects in context, at lower stimulus PT. This contextual disadvantage disappeared when PT increased, indicating that figure-ground separation with recurrent processing is vital for meaningful contextual processing to occur.

AB Traditional studies of human categorization often treat the processes of encoding features and cues as peripheral to the question of how stimuli are categorized. However, in domains where the features and cues are less transparent, how information is encoded prior to categorization may constrain our understanding of the architecture of categorization. This is particularly true in speech perception, where acoustic cues to phonological categories are ambiguous and influenced by multiple factors. Here, it is crucial to consider the joint contributions of the information in the input and the categorization architecture. We contrasted accounts that argue for raw acoustic information encoding with accounts that posit that cues are encoded relative to expectations, and investigated how two categorization architectures-exemplar models and back-propagation parallel distributed processing models-deal with each kind of information. Relative encoding, akin to predictive coding, is a form of noise reduction, so it can be expected to improve model accuracy; however, like predictive coding, the use of relative encoding in speech perception by humans is controversial, so results are compared to patterns of human performance, rather than on the basis of overall accuracy. We found that, for both classes of models, in the vast majority of parameter settings, relative cues greatly helped the models approximate human performance. This suggests that expectation-relative processing is a crucial precursor step in phoneme categorization, and that understanding the information content is essential to understanding categorization processes.

ID AUTOMATIC SPEECH RECOGNITION
AB Wavelet packet (WP) acoustic features are found to be very promising in unvoiced phoneme classification task but they are less effective to capture periodic information from voiced speech. This motivated us to develop a wavelet packet based feature extraction technique that signifies both the periodic and aperiodic information. This method is based on parallel distributed processing technique inspired by the human speech perception process. This front end feature processing technique employs Equivalent Rectangular Bandwidth (ERB) filter like wavelet speech feature extraction method called Wavelet ERB Sub-band based Periodicity and Aperiodicity Decomposition (WERB-SPADE). Winer filter is used at front end to minimize the noise for further processing. The speech signal is filtered by 24 band ERB like wavelet filter banks, and then the output of each sub-band is processed through comb filter. Each comb filter is designed individually for each sub-band to decompose the signal into periodic and aperiodic features. Thus it carries the periodic information without losing certain important information like formant transition incorporated in aperiodic features. Hindi phoneme classification experiments with a standard HMM recognizer under both clean-training and multi-training condition is conducted. This technique shows significant improvement in voiced phoneme class without affecting the performance of unvoiced phoneme class. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Current computer forensics tools have some limitations on anti-forensics attacks, cloud computing, and a large increase in the size of forensics targets. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a system that preserves storage data on virtual machines by acquiring all data sectors with time stamps. The proposed system can restore a previous state of a block device at any date and time that is specified by an investigator. The proposed system aims to monitor users' behavior in Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud platforms. This paper also presents a rapid file detection system that finds a target file from a large collection of the acquired data sectors by using sector-hashes and parallel distributed processing. This system enables investigators to track and to find a target file that is related to incidents or crimes in the cloud. First, this paper reports the preliminary experiments of a sector-hash based file detection method on three major operating systems for evaluating its effectiveness. We present a design and an implementation of the proposed monitoring and target file detection system by using Xen hypervisor and MapReduce. We report results of its performance evaluation. Finally, we discuss possible methods to improve the performance and the limitations of the current proposed mechanism.

TI A Neuro-Computational Approach to Understanding the Mental Lexicon

LA English
DT Article
DE Mental lexicon; dynamic storage; parallel distributed processing;
   hebbian learning; temporal self-organising maps
AB Human lexical knowledge does not appear to be organised to minimise storage, but rather to maximise processing efficiency. The way lexical information is stored reflects the way it is dynamically processed, accessed and retrieved. A detailed analysis of the way words are memorised, of the dynamic interaction between lexical representations and distribution and degrees of regularity in input data, can shed some light on the emergence of structures and relations within fully-stored words. We believe that a bottom-up investigation of low-level memory and processing functions can help understand the cognitive mechanisms that govern word processing in the mental lexicon. Neuro-computational models can play an important role in this inquiry, as they help understand the dynamic nature of lexical representations by establishing an explanatory connection between lexical structures and processing models dictated by the micro-functions of human brain.
   Starting from some linguistic, psycholinguistic and neuro-physiological evidence supporting a dynamic view of the mental lexicon as an integrative system, we illustrate Temporal Self Organising-Maps (TSOMs), artificial neural networks that can model such a view by memorising time series of symbolic units (words) as routinized patterns of short-term node activation. On the basis of a simple pool of principles of adaptive Hebbian synchronisation, TSOMs can perceive possible surface relations between word forms and store them by partially overlapping activation patterns, reflecting gradient levels of lexical specificity, from holistic to decompositional lexical representations. We believe that TSOMs offer an algorithmic model of the emergence of high-level, global and language-specific morphological structure through the working of low-level, language-aspecific processing functions, thus promising to bridge the persisting gap between high-level principles of grammar architecture (lexicon vs. rules), computational correlates (storage vs. processing) and low-level principles and localisations of brain functions. Extensions of the current TSOM architecture are envisaged and their theoretical implications are discussed.

AB This paper discusses a new algorithm, called the acoustic data-mining accelerator (ADA), which was developed to mine large sound archives for signals of interest including animal vocalizations. Background information on the development of ADA is provided, summarizing various projects that have utilized this technology since 2009. Performance was evaluated by comparing runtimes and efficiency metrics for two marine mammal detection algorithms that were applied to a 3-week single channel acoustic data set (sampled at 192 kHz and with 16 bit resolution). A total of four configurations (1, 8, 16 and 64 workers) demonstrated processing scalability. Results showed that each detection algorithm successfully processed the data set in all four configurations without changing the ADA algorithm. The fastest case (64 workers), had a total runtime performance of 1.5 hours; making the ADA 13 times more efficient than the serial case. Using a single worker it took more than 18 hours to process the same 3-week data set. Concurrent processing of both data-mining algorithms using 64 workers showed the highest efficiency gain (23x) compared to sequentially processing the data with a single worker.

AB The asymmetry of interference in a Stroop task usually refers to the well-documented result that incongruent colour words slow colour naming (Stroop effect) but incongruent colours do not slow colour word reading (no reverse Stroop effect). A few other studies have suggested that, more generally, a reverse Stroop effect can be occasionally observed but at the expense of the Stroop effect itself, as if interference was inherently unidirectional, from the stronger to the weaker of the two competing processes. We describe here a situation conducive to a pervasive mutual interference effect. Musicians were exposed to congruent and incongruent note name/note position patterns, and they were asked either to read the word while ignoring the location of the note within the staff, or to name the note while ignoring the note name written inside the note picture. Most of the participants exhibited interference in the two tasks. Overall, this result pattern runs against the still prevalent model of the Stroop phenomenon [Cohen, J. D., Dunbar, K., & McClelland, J. L. (1990). On the control of automatic processes: A parallel distributed processing account of the Stroop effect. Psychological Review, 97(3), 332-361]. However, further analyses lend support to one of the key tenets of the model, namely that the pattern of interference depends on the relative strength of the two competing pathways. The reasons for the impressive differences between the results collected in the present study and in the standard colour-word (or picture-word) paradigms are also examined. We suggest that these differences reveal the importance of stimulus-response contingency in the formation of automatisms.

AB Cloud computing service make possible applications by given that visualized resources that can be energetically allocated to virtual clusters. Nowadays IT companies and business companies make use of cloud environment for virtual storage and managing users. The job organization is the input position in cloud service and job arrangement troubles is vital competence of the whole cloud services. Job arrangement mechanism is the range of appropriate property for job implementation. A job arrangement has to make happy for virtual users to decide about Quality of Service. In this paper, the proposed method is used to enhance job arrangement and resource allotment by minimizing make span and reducing source price and safeguard error acceptance and quality service. The proposed algorithms have been evaluated with existing scheduling policies through CloudSim toolkit. The experimental results show that proposed framework gives better results in terms of execution time, user response, execution cost and time on different cloud workloads as compared to existing algorithms.
