2		2006	poldrack ra	can cognitive processes be inferred from neuroimaging data	trends in cognitive sciences	there is much interest currently in using functional neuroimaging techniques to understand better the nature of cognition one particular practice that has become common is reverse inference by which the engagement of a particular cognitive process is inferred from the activation of a particular brain region such inferences are not deductively valid but can still provide some information using a  analysis of the brainmap neuroimaging database i characterize the amount of additional evidence in favor of the engagement of a cognitive process that can be offered by a reverse inference its usefulness is particularly limited by the selectivity of activation in the region of interest i argue that cognitive neuroscientists should be circumspect in the use of reverse inference particularly when selectivity of the region in question cannot be established or is known to be weak

4		1997	myung ij pitt ma	applying occam razor in modeling cognition a  approach	psychonomic bulletin  review	in mathematical modeling of cognition it is important to have welljustified criteria for choosing among differing explanations ie models of observed data this paper introduces a  model selection approach that formalizes occam razor choosing the simplest model that describes the data well the choice of a model is carried out by taking into account not only the traditional model selection criteria ie a model fit to the data and the number of parameters but also the extension of the parameter space and most importantly the functional form of the model ie the way in which the parameters are combined in the model equation an advantage of the approach is that it can be applied to the comparison of nonnested models as well as nested ones application examples are presented and implications of the results for evaluating models of cognition are discussed
5		1991	anderson jr	is human cognition adaptive	behavioral and brain sciences	can the output of human cognition be predicted from the assumption that it is an optimal response to the informationprocessing demands of the environment  a methodology called rational analysis is described for deriving predictions about cognitive phenomena using optimization assumptions  the predictions flow from the statistical structure of the environment and not the assumed structure of the mind   inference is used assuming that people start with a weak prior model of the world which they integrate with experience to develop stronger models of specific aspects of the world  cognitive performance maximizes the difference between the expected gain and cost of mental effort  1 memory performance can be predicted on the assumption that retrieval seeks a maximal tradeoff between the probability of finding the relevant memories and the effort required to do so in 2 categorization performance there is a similar tradeoff between accuracy in predicting object features and the cost of hypothesis formation in 3 causal inference the tradeoff is between accuracy in predicting future events and the cost of hypothesis formation and in 4 problem solving it is between the probability of achieving goals and the cost of both external and mental problemolving search  the implemention of these rational prescriptions in neurally plausible architecture is also discussed

9		2011	jones m love bc	 fundamentalism or enlightenment on the explanatory status and theoretical contributions of  models of cognition	behavioral and brain sciences	the prominence of  modeling of cognition has increased recently largely because of mathematical advances in specifying and deriving predictions from complex probabilistic models much of this research aims to demonstrate that cognitive behavior can be explained from rational principles alone without recourse to psychological or neurological processes and representations we note commonalities between this rational approach and other movements in psychology  namely behaviorism and evolutionary psychology  that set aside mechanistic explanations or make use of optimality assumptions through these comparisons we identify a number of challenges that limit the rational program potential contribution to psychological theory specifically rational  models are significantly unconstrained both because they are uninformed by a wide range of processlevel data and because their assumptions about the environment are generally not grounded in empirical measurement the psychological implications of most  models are also unclear  inference itself is conceptually trivial but strong assumptions are often embedded in the hypothesis sets and the approximation algorithms used to derive model predictions without a clear delineation between psychological commitments and implementational details comparing multiple  models of the same task is rare as is the realization that many  models recapitulate existing mechanistic level theories despite the expressive power of current  models we argue they must be developed in conjunction with mechanistic considerations to offer substantive explanations of cognition we lay out several means for such an integration which take into account the representations on which  inference operates as well as the algorithms and heuristics that carry it out we argue this unification will better facilitate lasting contributions to psychological theory avoiding the pitfalls that have plagued previous theoretical movements
10		2011	jones m love bc	pinning down the theoretical commitments of  cognitive models	behavioral and brain sciences	mathematical developments in probabilistic inference have led to optimism over the prospects for  models of cognition our target article calls for better differentiation of these technical developments from theoretical contributions it distinguishes between  fundamentalism which is theoretically limited because of its neglect of psychological mechanism and  enlightenment which integrates rational and mechanistic considerations and is thus better positioned to advance psychological theory the commentaries almost uniformly agree that mechanistic grounding is critical to the success of the  program some commentaries raise additional challenges which we address here other commentaries claim that all  models are mechanistically grounded while at the same time holding that they should be evaluated only on a  level we argue this contradictory stance makes it difficult to evaluate a model scientific contribution and that the psychological commitments of  models need to be made more explicit

109		1993	shastri l ajjanagadde v	from simple associations to systematic reasoning  a connectionist representation of rules variables and dynamic bindings using temporal synchrony	behavioral and brain sciences	human agents draw a variety of inferences effortlessly spontaneously and with remarkable efficiency  as though these inferences were a reflexive response of their cognitive apparatus furthermore these inferences are drawn with reference to a large body of background knowledge this remarkable human ability seems paradoxical given the complexity of reasoning reported by researchers in artificial intelligence it also poses a challenge for cognitive science and  neuroscience how can a system of simple and slow neuronlike elements represent a large body of systemic knowledge and perform a range of inferences with such speed we describe a  model that takes a step toward addressing the cognitive science challenge and resolving the artificial intelligence paradox we show how a connectionist network can encode millions of facts and rules involving nary predicates and variables and perform a class of inferences in a few hundred milliseconds efficient reasoning requires the rapid representation and propagation of dynamic bindings our model which we refer to as shruti achieves this by representing 1 dynamic bindings as the synchronous firing of appropriate nodes 2 rules as interconnection patterns that direct the propagation of rhythmic activity and 3 longterm facts as temporal patternmatching subnetworks the model is consistent with recent neurophysiological evidence that synchronous activity occurs in the brain and may play a representational role in neural information processing the model also makes specific psychologically significant predictions about the nature of reflexive reasoning it identifies constraints on the form of rules that may participate in such reasoning and relates the capacity of the working memory underlying reflexive reasoning to biological parameters such as the lowest frequency at which nodes can sustain synchronous oscillations and the coarseness of synchronization
110		1994	towell gg shavlik jw	knowledgebased artificial neural networks	artificial intelligence	hybrid learning methods use theoretical knowledge of a domain and a set of classified examples to develop a method for accurately classifying examples not seen during training the challenge of hybrid learning systems is to use the information provided by one source of information to offset information missing from the other source by so doing a hybrid learning system should learn more effectively than systems that use only one of the information sources kbann knowledgebased artificial neural networks is a hybrid learning system built on top of connectionist learning techniques it maps problempecific domain theories represented in propositional logic into neural networks and then refines this reformulated knowledge using backpropagation kbann is evaluated by extensive empirical tests on two problems from molecular biology among other results these tests show that the networks created by kbann generalize better than a wide variety of learning systems as well as several techniques proposed by biologists

112		1997	gaskell mg marslenwilson wd	integrating form and meaning a  model of speech perception	language and cognitive processes	we present a new  connectionist model of the perception of spoken words the model employs a representation of speech that combines lexical information with abstract phonological information with lexical access modelled as a direct mapping onto this single  representation we first examine the integration of partial cues to phonological identity showing that the model provides a sound basis for simulating phonetic and lexical decision data from marslenwilson and warren 1994 we then investigate the time course of lexical access and argue that the process of competition between word candidates during lexical access can be interpreted in terms of interference between  lexical representations the relation between our model and other models of spoken word recognition is discussed

182		1992	murre jmj phaf rh wolters g	calm  categorizing and learning module	neural networks	a new procedure calm  categorizing and learning module is introduced for unsupervised learning in modular neural networks  the work described addresses a number of problems in connectionist modeling such as lack of speed lack of stability inability to learn either with or without supervision and the inability to both discriminate between and generalize over patterns  calm is a single module that can be used to construct larger networks  a calm module consists of pairs of excitatory representation and inhibitory vetonodes and an arousalnode  because of the fixed internal wiring pattern of a module the arousalnode is sensitive to the novelty of the input pattern  the activation of the arousalnode determines two psychologically motivated types of learning operating in the module  elaboration learning which implies a high learning rate and the distribution of nonspecific random activations in the module and activation learning which has only base rate learning without random activations  the learning rule used is a modified version of a rule described by grossberg  the workings of calm networks are illustrated in a number of simulations  it is shown that a calm module quickly reaches a categorization even with new patterns  though categorization and learning are relatively fast compared to other models calm modules do not suffer from excessive plasticity  they are also shown to be capable of both discriminating between and generalizing over patterns  when presented with a pattern set exceeding the number of representationnodes similar patterns are assigned to the same node  multimodular simulations showed that with supervised learning an average of 16 presentations sufficed to learn the exor function  moreover an unsupervised learning version of the mcclelland and rumelhart model successfully simulated a word superiority effect  it is concluded that the incorporation of psychologically and biologically plausible structural and functional characteristics like modularity unsupervised competitive learning and a novelty dependent learning rate may contribute to solving some of the problems often encountered in connectionist modeling
